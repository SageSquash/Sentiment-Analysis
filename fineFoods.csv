55389,Happy couple,1,I have a black lab/border terrier mix.  She hasn't had any problems with any other rawhide (even the cheap brands).  These made her violently sick with excessive vomiting and diarrhea (I was up all night taking her out every 20 minutes).  This went on for 24 hours with no signs of stopping. She became severely lethargic.  She wouldn't drink water or eat food and our vet decided that we should bring her in to put her on fluids because she became so dehydrated.  In the end it cost $175 in vet bills.  Today she is back to normal and the rawhides are at a garbage dump somewhere.<br /><br />Amazon refunded our money with no problems whatsoever and I would still highly recommend them to consumers.

222641,"M. Smith ""cenmad""",1,"I was really happy to find another cat treat that was natural and free of fillers/preservatives/chemicals.  That said, none of my four cats will touch this stuff, even though two of them eat almost anything.  Much better to give them treats like Three Dog Bakery ""We Pity the Kitties"" freeze-dried salmon,  Feline Greenies, or just plain tuna."
96579,Mabes,1,I have two overweight cats and they were put on a high protein diet to lose weight. I was looking for a high protein cat food that I didn't have to purchase at the vet. My cats are not picky eaters and they hated it.  I had to wash the dishes before they would even consider eating another food out of them. My dog wouldn't even clean up the pieces that were on the floor. It is also crumbles very easily so there is a powder residue everywhere.
506376,N. M. Wescott,1,"THERE ARE WARNINGS ALL OVER THE NEWS AND INTERNET!!!  DO NOT FEED THESE TO YOUR DOG!!!!  THEY ARE MADE IN CHINA, AND CHICKEN JERKY MADE IN CHINA HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH NUMEROUS CASES OF KIDNEY FAILURE!  .....You don't have to take my word for it....Google it.<br /><br />I purchased some from Costco, although my Aussie loved them, she started having urinary tract problems.  I immediately threw out the open bag and am returning the unopened bag.  I say a prayer every day, and hope she hasn't been hurt by this product.<br /><br />PLEASE do NOT feed your pet anything that is made outside the USA!!  There are many great products made right here in the USA, yes they may cost a bit more, but Is your pet's health and life really worth saving a few $$$?????<br /><br />DO NOT GIVE THESE TO YOUR DOG!!!!!!!!!!"
78256,Pamela,1,"The only reason this product got a 1 star is I can't give it a 0! The picture and product info lead me to believe I will be getting a plant, I received a seed, one seed and it did not grow. I do read the reviews, and then tend to temper my decisions based on whether or not I am willing to take the risk. However, when  see 1 review I think okay maybe a bad purchase. I chose to make my decision and purchased the ""magic can"". Shame on me, I have now decided to add my review in the hopes that the next buyer will save themselves some headache. The item has not produced a plant of any kind,and I have waited almost a month now. The growing medium is nothing I have ever seen before, sparkles and fluff, and one little seed inside the can. The whole experience was a dud."
141093,"Tomcat ""Techie""",1,"Just ran out of my three year storage. This new garbage is not nutricious. A good product turned bad because some CEO made that decision. One of my last enjoyments in life; and they plugged me on that as well. What is his name; so I can thank him on the street, We need rough men at the ready; to purge men like these in thier ivory towers, Go straight to hell buddy."
216934,"Painter ""Samantha""",1,"You have to use a lot more that the Trader Joe's brand or other brands I have used in the past, including liquid stevia. It is more like a slightly sweetened white powder.<br /><br />This Stevia is the lightest I have ever used. I will not buy it again."
545240,Kelly L. Delahunty,1,I love La Panzanella croccantini but was unsure about what shape they would arrive in through Amazon.  I have always had excellent service and packaging so I thought it was worth a try.  The first box came beautifully packaged with the air-pocket packaging.  The crackers were in great shape and absolutely delicious. I was so pleased that I started the Subscribe and Save feature having these shipped once each month.  The first shipment through Subscribe and Save was completely crushed.  There were 2 small sheets of bubble wrap for 6 packagages and there was nothing between the packages.  Only about 10% of the crackers are in a reasonable enough size to consider eating them.  I went online to customer service and found out that they can't be returned.  This is an expensive item that is fragile and is sent to you with no recourse for return when you're shipped the small fragments due to poor packaging on Amazon's part.  I wouldn't risk it!
330939,Maria Lee,1,"The Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Pizza Crust was really bad.  The taste and texture.  Also one of the bags had burst open and there was flour all over in the box.  I ordered three different boxes of Gluten Free products with four bags in each box, and the end bag in each box had burst open.  I just called Bob's Red Mill and they were extremely nice and just sent me the bags right away."

119534,dcarr,1,"I just spent $1,400 on dental work for my two dogs, both of whom broke multiple teeth on these bones.  The Bones do prevent tartar build-up but at an unacceptable cost.  I believe this product should carry safety warnings because the vet told us that this is a common problem with the hard bones."
334097,Tryfle,1,"For the price you could get an oil that actually deserves the name ""extra-virgin"" (that refers to the QUALITY of the oil by the way, and not the ORIGIN).  Look up the recent consumer reports review on extra virgin olive oils and try one of those.  I put up with this one until my brother in law gave us a couple of Sciabica's (also available at Amazon), what an unbelievable difference.  Won't use this pig swill again."
477355,eve,1,"Oh gawd.. it tastes so unbelievably aweful I had to leave a feedback!<br />I would so NOT recommend this product to anyone, not even if it's the last thing left to eat on this planet."
143734,"Rouzbeh Salehinia ""Nov""",1,"is this a joke with almost $13.00 difference in price, amazon is ripping us off,lol i mean why but formula online anyway because of the time it takes, but did someone in amazon corp offices did any research or they just thought people wouldn't care?"
49017,Judy,1,"Received two gifts of Omaha Steaks for Christmas and anxiously looked forward to a holiday meal of steak, twice-baked potatoes and apple tartlets.  However, the steaks were tough and very disappointing-the potatoes and tartlets were delicious.  My anticipation for future meals is now quite diminished.  I will, most definitely, share my experience with the gift givers.  Ins't that a shame?"
262592,Rachel K. Walker,1,"Five stars? Really? Who is writing these reviews? This candy is disgusting. The texture was off-putting to start and then the flavor, eeeyuuuckkk just sugar mixed with sugar mixed with even more sugar. Kinda fun to give to people though, as you watch them try to figure out what is happening."
279769,S. Weinberg,1,"I like Folgers coffee, I like chocolate.  How bad could this be?  Turns out very bad.  An overwhelming flavor of cheap hot chocolate drowns out whatever coffee flavor there is."
189853,4HealthyMe,1,"This product may be great for tanning (over your sunscreen of course), but it is not good for cooking unless you are making a coconut pie, cake or cookies (GF of course) because it tastes and smells like coconut.<br /><br />I should have been tipped off by the plastic container and by what appears to be a lower than I expected melting point, but I admit that I was looking for an economical solution to Subscribe & Save for my adult children as I do all that I can to help them eat right.  I am telling them to use this as body oil and I will buy them some Spectrum Naturals Coconut Oil."
515645,Kristie,1,"I had brought these in the store.. They are absolutely horriable! I make mine every year and decided to grab a bag on my way to work. They taste like sea salt water. Very disappointed with them coming from the company. Its a pain to clean and bake your own seeds, but I rather do that then try to eat another on of these."
69914,"M. Copeland ""puddykat""",1,"Until this year, these chocolates were the best.  Kirkland (Costco) has substitutes most of the chocolates with cheaper chocolates.  These are not gourmet chocolates anymore. I won't be buying these anymore.  The countries listed need to be revised.  United States is now one of the chocolate producers.  I'm guessing they are the cheaper, less tasty ones.  Oddly, Switzerland chocolates are last on the list, or the least amount you will get.<br />P.S.  These are only $9.99 at Costco."
413381,Lachen,1,"A package of Gourmet Valley Heirloom Beans Red Calypso Beans were purchased at the very tony Ferry Plaza in San Francisco in January.  For something like ten dollars.  We attempted to cook them over the weekend, but after 17 hours with the beans, which had been pre-soaked overnight, still quite hard, we pitched them, knowing they would be a joke forever.  We realize now that they are called Heirloom Beans because they are from some long ago harvest.  Perhaps during the Great Depression, when beans were carefully stored.  Caution:  Stay far away from even thinking about purchasing these beans!"
144364,"Roadhunter ""Roadhunter""",1,"I wanted so badly to love these peanuts.  The texture is absolutely perfect.  However, the salt quickly sneaks up on your.  They are over salted to the point eating them becomes physically painful.  Huge failure that could easily be turned into a success."
213,"Desert Girl ""chrissylovesherhusband""",1,"As with canidae, Felidae has also changed their formula.  Cats do not like change when it comes to their food.  And they just had to change it without putting it on their label.  We noticed the color of the food had changed and so did the smell.  (As you will notice I have also reviewd the Canidae, and this all happened the same time the dogs were having issues.)<br /><br />Prior to the change in food we had almost lost two of our cats because we had moved to a new home.  If cats get ""upset"" because of a change in enviorment, or a loud noise they can stop eating.  It depends on the cat.  Two of them had stopped eating and had lost a lot of weight.  We took them to the vet and it took months to get them back to normal.  It has been a year since then and they are better.  Then the formula for this food changed.<br /><br />We started to noitce they were not eating as much and it started to bug us.  We asked the shop owner of the feed store and she had no knowledge of any change to the food.  It wasn't until the we were in there with other customers yelling about their dogs food making their dogs sick.  Right away we changed the cats food and they started chowing down and haven't suffered one bit like our dogs have.<br /><br />Cats are sensitve animals and changes to thier food could cause them to stop eating.  Anyone thinking of purchasing this food should not do it!  We have 5 rescued and fixed cats, none of which are picky eaters and the change in this formula could have been the death of them had we not found out about the change in their formula.<br /><br />I urge anyone that has had these problems to go to the consumer affairs website and also the FDA website and write a letter to them to let them know how this has affected your animal.  As with canidae they do not care how the change has affected my animals, and tell me not to buy it.  This is just horrible!"
197419,"James J. Henshaw ""The Shaw""",1,The item was damaged in transit and was returned to the sender by the USPS.  I had to drive 30 miles to the nearest store to purchase the product on Christmas Eve day.
531202,AShopper,1,"These apricots are of high quality, however they seem to be packaged too moist, and rapidly develop a white mold.  The spooky part is, the mold looks like sugar, and some folks, especially kids, might mistake it for a normal condition.  A couple of other things are odd:  There is no expiration date on the package, and each bag has a hole in the bottom, looking as if it has been punctured by a needle.  After a month or so in storage, all 8 of my remaining bags were in the same decomposing condition.<br />Please see attached pictures under product information, images section."
320966,L. Nelson,1,"These came with the plastic wrappers melted into the candy. It was impossible to get all of the wrapper off of the candy, so you end up eating plastic."

200355,"Rosey ""Rosey""",1,This coffee is extremely weak and the added flavoring for the Creme Brulee is weak also.  Not worth trying.
15554,susan m. kaitz,1,I received all containers previously opened - all seals were opened. On the top of containers was decent pieces of liver and below that were grisley pieces and a lot of powder on the bottom. I will never buy liver treats from Amazon again. BIG RIP-OFF!
90158,Jacqueline,1,"Even my kids would not drink this!! This was awful, smells like a locker room and tasted like salt.. YUCK!!!!!"
146020,julz,1,I wish I would have read the return policy before I bought the beans. NO RETURNS & the coffee was terrible. The beans looked old and dried out. Coffee was weak & not very rich in flavor. I read other reviews and it sounded great. I use a french press and used the same amount of coffee as I do with any other espresso that I buy and it is no where near the same. Tried adding more coffee and still was not good. now i have a couple pounds of beans.....guess I will donate them to the free store or to someone that is use to automatic drip
394980,"K. Mooney ""Take it Literally""",1,"I am beyond dissappointed!  After trying these in December, I decided to order a whole case!  It took over a month to get here...and now I know why.<br /><br />They taste like some VERY VERY watered down coffee - mixed with DISHWATER.  Yes, I would have to say that these are now the WORST coffee candies I have ever had.  If you happen to have any made in 2006, you should savour them because that's the end of them.<br /><br />I just scraped off the new label so I can tell you the original ingredient list: Sugar, glucose, milk powder, coffee extract, coffee flavor, vegetable oil, salt, caramel.<br /><br />If your first ingredient is Glucose Syrup (tapioca)...then put them right back where you found them.  You will be wasting your money & insulting your tastebuds."
530114,Linda B Kivitz,1,"I was very disappointed in these peanuts.  It almost looks like these were factory seconds where almost every bag had a peanut smashed into the plastic seal.  In some cases this actually ruined the integrity of the packaging. We are planning on using these as wedding favors and aren't sure we can even use them given how disgusting a crushed, salty, soggy nut is when sandwiched in a plastic seal."
430094,S. Wyffels,1,"I ordered these products through prime, and they appeared to be packaged properly.<br /><br />Every single bag was damaged in the manufacturing process, and I was unable to use any of the products. It appears the products were not checked before sending, and there was a slit down the side of every single bag.  All 4 boxes appeared to come from the same production batch.  To top it off I cannot return the products.  So now I am out $19 dollars, and I cannot use BioBag's compost bin which I also bought.  Can't say everyone will get the same bags, but buyer beware.<br /><br />I have pictures, but I cannot upload them in this review."
386444,M. Goodman,1,"This coffee smells and tastes absolutely disgusting.  It smells like sugared rubbing alcohol.  It tastes like vomit.  I have never disliked a coffee flavor so much before, and I am at a complete loss when it comes to explaining how it got such favorable reviews.<br /><br />I bought the item elsewhere and  cannot comment on the seller."
514074,M.N.,1,"Ordered 3 boxes of hard-to-find One:One Melitta coffee pods, 18 pods in each box.  Expected what was shown in picture and product description.  I received the wrong size pods, different name and different package (container). Not what was ordered. Told them, but no response.  Not too happy about this. First disappointment of an order placed through Amazon."

It stayed on for a day or two which bothered me a lot. So I still have the rest. Sitting there..."
245562,"E. Thomsen ""arvig""",1,"I bought this service with the hopes that Ms. Deen herself or at least one of her employees would come out to my house and offer the service indicated in the title, a ""Butt massage"". No, I don't expect anything erotic or anything like that before someone makes such an accusation, I simply put have a sore tush and from time to time need someone to massage it so it's not so tender and painful. Now, did I get said service! No! I instead got two 2.77 ounce shakers of spices. Well, I decided that maybe this isn't the butt of some joke and figured maybe the idea was to ""self serve"" if you will, to massage my own behind with the spices. I did this, and I developed a rash the next day! I will NOT order this product again.<br /><br />The spices would probably be okay on pork though. But I don't own any livestock to massage so for me that is moot.<br /><br />As an aside, this is a cut and paste of my review of a different size of Ms. Deen's butt massage service, thus the reference to two 2.77 ounce shakers.  Even so, given the only difference is the size of the jar my comments there should apply to here fine."
357367,"Summer ""Breeze""",1,"This product does not meet those amazon.com standards upon which I have developed a trust.

I'm still questioning how I misread what little information is given.<br /><br />...........Product Features: Mini Candy Rocks made of candy. Soft chewy center with jelly beans like candy shell. Approximately 70 pcs per pound.<br /><br />Please notice that the Product Description block is blank. Hmmmm. Could the lack of a description be a deliberate mislead?<br /><br />The package arrived three days after my order was placed, and the only information on the plastic bag's little white paper sticker (1"" X 2 1/4"") is the bar code, and the words ""Candy Rocks - Pebbles 5LB Bag.""  On the bag's back side is a black, badly-faded ink stamp (this is a CLEAR plastic bag containing dark-mottled candy) that says ""Nutrition Fact."" However, whatever the rest of the ""message"" is illegible.<br /><br />Isn't there a federal law requiring a proper label showing ingredient listings and indicating a product is safe and wholesome? Yes, there is. ""The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for assuring that foods sold in the United States are safe, wholesome and properly labeled. This applies to foods produced domestically, as well as foods from foreign countries.

88124,TheOC,1,"I feel mislead by the name of this product as the ingredient list on the package lists pears first then peas and then broccoli. When I tasted it myself I realized why my daughter was enjoying it so much, it just tasted like sweet pears.

213272,"J. Taylor ""pleasantchick""",1,"I really liked how my hair looked at first when I tried this shampoo but by day 3 and 4 I started developing itchy bumps on my scalp. I also realized that this product was leaving a film on my hair. I had been using sulfate free shampoos for the last few years but I broke down and bought this because of all the great reviews. This shampoo is not for everyone. If you're at all sensitive to chemicals, stay away. I went back to an awesome shampoo that I stick with. Every time I try something new, nothing treats my hair and scalp the way Henna Hut shampoos do. I've tried them all and I like their Neem shampoo the best. I don't work for them. I'm just a customer who appreciates them more and more every time I try other products."
224232,Dr. D,1,"We had one of these cubes for 3 years for our English Springer Spaniel. He loved it. One day he got his canine tooth stuck in the round insert. He immediately began howling in pain.  He was howling so loudly while my husband and I safely detached it. I have never heard my dog cry this way before, or since then. We immediately threw away the cube.  By the way, the cube was not damaged when it caught his canine tooth.  It was a freak occurrence, but one we would never chance again.  We were lucky."
122688,Alexi Darling,1,"My little Lhasa loved these, but she threw up big balls of starch.  Apparently, this is such a common problem, Zuke's is soon taking this line off the market and releasing a new replacement product in the next few months.  Small dogs don't have the digestive track needed to process these.  They will be switching from the existing potato formula to a more digestible Tapioca line.<br /><br />I need to hand it to Zuke's though. I told them about the product, and they rushed to send me samples and refund my money."
505581,"sally forth ""rainyreads""",1,These rice cakes arrived  ( 6 boxes worth) with a short shelf life of just about a month.  Jan 2012!!!  Had I known this I would never have ordered them!  They are nearly stale and Amazon does not take back food items as a return.  I do not expect food bought on Amazon to be such that the  short shelf life will mean wasted money and food thrown away because of staleness.  Terrible practice.  No one to contact because of the no return policy on food.  If Amazon is going to deal with food items they should have the policy of fairness and send out only  foods with s reasonable shelf life.  120 rice cakes eaten within 1 month is a bit much in my opinion.  I have ordered and received these rice cakes earlier and they were fine.  Tasty and good shelf life.  It is frustrating not to be able to request a refund for this item.  I would not chance buying any of this product ever again unless I could be assured of  freshness and a decent shelf life.  Do not take a chance on this if you want fresh item  and are watching how you spend your money.
208218,srg,1,I opened my box hoping for a great snack-to-go and what a dissappointment! It tastes like the fat is rancid in these. I opened another box to see if maybe I got a bad box but they were just as awful. My dog won't even eat them.

Crystal light relatively closely approximates that.<br /><br />It seemed like Mio it would be convenient to use.<br /><br />First I had trouble with the packaging.  It was hard to appropriately tear the plastic cover off.  I also had trouble with the directions.  I am 49 and my near vision is going the way most people in their 40s goes... I can't read the directions without finding reading glasses.  Could the manufacturers possibly consider their over-40 customers valuable and print just a little bigger?!<br /><br />My first squirt of the liquid went past the glass.  Ok.  So that will only happen once but..  Although mixing crystal light powder doesn't bother me and I am sure this is a liquid version of something similar, squirting the brown liquid into the water was not appetizing.  I felt like it was a chemistry experiment.<br /><br />When I drank the tea, I continued to think of it as a chemical experiment.  It tasted ""chemically""  Again, just not appealing.  I admit I may have been influenced by the ""squirting in"" process.<br /><br />It is not something I will buy again.  I will stick to Crystal Light and Snapple."

16045,Sara,1,I recently started eating healthier and needed a low calorie chip to eat with lunches at work. I usually love anything ranch flavored and was excited to try the new Southwest Ranch cracker chips. Their flavor was actually TERRIBLE! I literally thought they tasted like poo. I could only force myself to eat two or three chips. I then had my friend taste them (hoping I could give away the box) and he hated them too. Now I have almost a whole box of these  that I will be throwing away. The texture wasn't very appealing either so I'm not sure if I will ever try another flavor.
134514,"Bruce L. Nelson ""'Alone Across Alaska' and '7...",1,"My dachshund recently needed to start taking pills three times a day. He figured out there were sometimes pills in hot dog pieces (something to try nonetheless) so he began carefully checking each piece and spitting out the pills. So I tried Pill Pockets. The first one worked, and that was the last time. He won't even taste them now. So for me, Pill Pockets were expensive and ineffective. I now cook him up some chicken hearts and conceal the pills inside every day as needed while he isn't looking, then trim them down to barely cover the pill. I get him excited by quickly feeding him the trimmings, followed up by the main piece with the pill inside. On occasion he still finds them, but he likes chicken so much that it works quite well, so far, anyway.<br /><br />Obviously Pill Pockets work very good for most people, but not for me and my dog."

It may have deterred the skunks for one(!) night but most likely they filled their belly somewhere else.  Havahart is being very generous in their marketing saying that it lasts up to 30 days.  Perhaps if the lawn was literally buried with this stuff.  Not worth the money.
518512,Tiny Evil,1,"After getting fed up with catching insects crawling in my room, I decided to give this product a try. The instructions are pretty simple and the product seemed promising. I placed a trap in every corner of every room and hoped it would take care of my insect problem. It has been a week since the traps were placed and nothing has been caught. The pests that it was supposed to trap are actually crawling over it, under it, beside it, anywhere except in it. Needless to say this has been a major disappointment."

I love the Lipton's it's rich and spicy and tastes like drinking Christmas...I want some right now! So, I cannot recommend this at all.

You don't have to be finicky to disapprove of these. (1) They've got a stringy thing hanging off of them. (2) They are small (3) If they haven't fallen apart by the time you open the can, they will by the time you get them to your mouth. Probably more wrong too but I'm trying to stomach my way through them by making stew. I have to put them in a strainer first to rinse off whatever crap that is on them, cook them in butter and lot's of salt & pepper before I put in milk. Then close my eyes & try to palate them. I would never feed them to a friend. I think Amazon would take them back but they have been so good about that on bad products I hate to ask them."

228491,Jordan,1,"The pop came very fast but I was extremely disappointed to find that this flavor was very odd and tasted nothing like raspberries. The pop was far too carbonated as well. This was far more carbonated than what we buy in the store. I would of asked for a full refund or exchange but decided against it as I do not believe it is covered under Amazon's policy. Not anything like the others we have tried (Almost all of them, and all at our local market). It makes me very skeptical about buying online when it is so different a product in store. Of course I purchased Raspberry online because it was unavailable in the store. It is also a shame to have 24 cans of an inferior product. Almost every can has been used up and it was really a chore as we normally drink 6 cans within 2 days and we've had these cans for about a month at least. Lastly, it wasn't just one can but every one in the package."
516715,Paul,1,"I ordered (8/24/12) the Ranch Dressing through Amazon.  I was so irritated to learn, upon receipt, that the expiration date is Novemer 27, 2012.  There is no way that I will use 80 ounces of dressing in less than three months.  I'm angry that Amazon would even stock, and ship, dressing that is so close to being expired.  Angie did refund me.  THANKS ANGIE!!! But, stil, I'm mad that I had to even go through all this for Ranch Dressing.  Disappointed with Amazon, really DISAPPOINTED!!!!"
455102,Guy,1,"It really hard is hard to ruin Mac and Cheese and this brand did just that. The cheese has a runny, strange texture, the taste is bland, and there is a unfavorable aftertaste.

308756,Joan M. McCullough,1,"This is my all-time favorite spice; we call it ""secret weapon"" around our kitchen.  We use it profusely.  Last time I bought this was in September of 2009, 3 flats for a total of 36 pieces.  I was about to reorder today and notice the price has gone through the roof, i.e., there has been a WHOPPING TWENTY-FOUR PERCENT INCREASE.  So I checked other websites which sell the individual, 3 oz. shakers.  Those prices are unchanged.  Next on the agenda:  check the Euro/dollar exchange rate.  In September of 2009, the simple average for the month was ~145 which is ~ where the Euro/dollar is trading now.  Mentioning the exchange rate, though, is only meant for purposes of example  Because Aromat is manufactured by Unilever which is a huge multinational corporation.  Therefore I am ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN that they have currency hedges in place to avoid wild price fluctuations such as an ungodly 24%. Bottom line:  THERE IS NO REASON FOR THE PRODUCT ITSELF TO HAVE HAD ANY WHERE NEAR THIS PRICE MOVE.  So I am going to chalk this up to increased shipping costs, noting that what used to be ""1 day shipping"" and ""2 day shipping"" are now more like 2 and 3-day, respectively.  On top of that, the #3.99 flat fee for what used to be true 1 day shipping was modified about a year ago to be #3.99 PER ITEM additional shipping even if they ship in the same box.  I also understand that signing up for regular, repeat shipping of an item does not ""LOCK"" the price in for the duration.  Amazing.  These not-so-subtle changes over time tell me that we can expect more of the same across the board.  And as consumers, we have to make hard choices. Because next on the agenda, the States will likely push for taxes.  Add that on top of the wildly escalating cost of shipping and it won't make sense for me to do so much on-line shopping because convenience can only offset so much of the cost. And that threshold is approaching fast. I am now exploring ordering this item in bulk directly from Europe.  It used to be available here in 2.2 lb. packages (1 kilogram)but that was discontinued.  However, they still package it like that all over Europe ... and Asia in the large size.  No more Amazon on this one!  Very, very unfortunate."

438003,Suelynn Teran,1,So I thought that since I had never been ripped off by Amazon I would continue shopping for things on the site. I live in Texas and the only place to get these chips were from out of town or directly from the company EXCEPT they charge an arm and a leg for shipping a box of these chips to ones house. With that said i decided to purchase them from this seller and was VERY unsatisfied... I was truly disappointed in my purchase. Below are the reasons why:<br /><br />1. The bags were ALL deflated<br />2. The apple chips were stale<br />3. Some of the bags were opened<br />4. There weren't exactly 60 as it mentioned<br />5. The expiration date one some of the bags were over due<br /><br />The upside was that shipping costs were low and they delivered in a timely manner. Other than that there really was not much else good to say about this product. At this point I would have gladly spent the 20 dollars on shipping chargers from Seneca than to have bout them from the seller.

136477,LW,1,"We preordered the 36 count Brooklyn Bean Roastery Fuhgeddaboutit K-cup product before it was released. When the order arrived the shipping and all packaging was perfect with no damage to any part of the order. When we began to brew the individual K-cups in our Keurig brewer there was a problem with grounds in the coffee and the brewer had a tendency to clog up using the Brooklyn Bean Roastery brand K-cup. The individual K-cups all seemed to be a normal size with no apparent damage. We have owned our Keurig brewer for several years and tried a large amount of other brands and coffee types without any problem. I'm not sure if this was a bad box or bad batch of the product, but we continue to use our brewer on all other brands with no problems."

The wasabi flavor was not the problem - the dead fish flavor was.

So true - TOTALLY DISGUSTING!!!  It took brushing my teeth FIVE times to that nasty taste out of my mouth.

After all, they are a ""farm,"" right? Understanding that some ""organic"" beans come from China, I thought I would call Barry Farms to confirm the country of origin for their beans. The female who took my call told me that they don't know where these beans come from since they get them from a distributor (so much for the ""farm"" in ""Barry Farms""). I asked if she could give me the contact information for the distributor so that I could ask them directly. Her answer: ""no"". I asked if THEY could find out from the distributor where these beans come from. Her answer: ""no"". Thanks, but I'll do my business elsewhere.<br /><br />UPDATE: I ended up buying from Italian Harvest - a dot com.<br />SECOND UPDATE: Italian Harvest no longer has an organic Borlotti/Cranberry bean, so this year I purchased from Purcell Mountain Farms, and am very pleased with their product."

2999,Dicey,1,"Reading in earlier reviews that these were genuine chinese fortunes, I served them with a chinese Christmas dinner and was greatly disappointed, as were my guests.  Three sample fortunes are:  ""Life is not a struggle.  It's a wiggle.""  ""Management is doing things right: leadership is doing the right things.""  ""If you're feeling down, try throwing yourself into your work.""  These are not fortunes, they are self-help mini-bites.  A fortune is:  ""Your love of travel will soon be satisfied,"" and it doesn't matter if they are predictive or not.  What matters is that they state a fortune.  ""Beware the dog in the corner house,"" would be fun to get.  ""Life is a wiggle"" is boring.<br />The cookies arrived on schedule, as promised, and in good condition in their individual wrappers.

187486,iamdragonrider,1,"You get a good number of the treats, even thought they are still pricey.  They are very soft, and quite a few were pretty squished, though the treats are soft enough you could likely mold them around the pill if need be I suppose.  As for the cat... he gobbled up the empty ones in seconds.  He eagerly gobbled up the one with the pill as well, only as soon as he bit into it and discovered the pill, and out onto the floor it went.  He did like the treat enough to lick the treat off a bit though, leaving the soggy pill behind.  Another empty he ate slightly hesitantly, and for a wonder the next with a pill actually went down the way it was supposed to.  Yay! I thought, no more struggling with pills.  The next time though, he bit into the treat and found the pill again.  In fact, he'd deliberately nibble at it, uncovering the pill.  After that, when I tried again, he started to refuse the treats at all, even without a pill.  In fact, he'd gotten so distrustful so quickly of the hidden pill trick, he even distrusted any soft treat for several days after and I had to resort to crunchy ones as his reward for swallowing pills.  It's too bad he seems to chew his food rather than bolting it. (hiding pills in food never worked for him either) I think if he didn't chew, they might have worked better.  As it is, we now resort to a routine.  He gets fed, then picked up and carried to a particular chair.  He gets sat up to recieve the pill, pill goes in, and he's rewarded with treats as soon as the pill goes down.  After several times of the routine, while he doesn't come running for it, he settles down and stops struggling and running away right after.  Rather, he looks about eagerly as if to say, ""where's my treat?  I'm supposed to get a treat now you know.""  At least the pill pockets were useful for that much at any rate!"

Not only does the package look fancy and have a fancy name, and not only does it say ""A European Classic"" (this is an American product), and not only does it say ""Gourmet Hot Cocoa"" (because at an expensive restaurant I always ask the chef for ""corn syrup solids""), but worst of all ""Savor the flavor of old world style chocolate"": because I'm sure in the old world they mixed a nice helping of partially hydrogenated soybean oil and silicon dioxide into their hot chocolate.<br /><br />Someone gave me a package of this stuff and I'm debating whether or not to eat it, so I can't comment on the taste.

8213,Reviews,1,"I finally did the research on this temptation treats and I'm glad to see that my suspicions are correct. I have been buying this treats for my kitty for years and suspected them all along to be the cause of him vomiting. Ironically, I even bought the hairball ones to see if they would make him stop vomiting. Now is official, I stopped giving them to him as often, and then monitored him whenever I gave him any. It soon became clear to me that he only vomits whenever I give him this treats. Sometimes he would vomit within minutes, and other times he would vomit during the night or the next morning, but if I give him this treats, I'm sure to be cleaning up orangee throw up off my carpet soon after.  I think is a matter of allergy or sensitivity to one of the ingredients, and they probably don't do anything to other cats but I'm never buying this again for my kitty."

208005,J. Fraga,1,"Okay, I decided to pick this up because it was on sale for a unbelievably low price. and I also love a good Blue Cheese dressing. So that evening I made a salad and opened it to pour some on. Well, it was certainly thick and creamy, which gave it good eye appeal, and smelled decent too. So I put a good amount on the salad, then took a great big bite, and oh my God, it tasted like a mouthful of creamy, tart, mixed-up, ""cleaning chemicals""! An, almost ammonia like taste! I immediately grabbed the bottle to make sure I hadn't accidentally put the cleaning product I had also bought that day in the fridge by accident, literally!!<br /><br />All of ""it"" went in the garbage almost as fast as that bite I took flew out my mouth! And, perhaps that thick and creamy look was ""floor wax"" in there! OK I'm kidding, but what a God awful excuse for a Blue Cheese dressing!

Unfortunately for me I did not do a small test amount before applying this Christmas Red to the entire batch - it has completely spoilt the frosting, leaving it with a harsh, very unpleasant after taste.  I have purchased cakes from Costco in the past and have learned to avoid anything that has red frosting as I get the exact same taste.  I also did not find this to be anywhere close to a Christmas red, perhaps I did not use enough, but given the resulting taste having only achieved a pinkish red, I can only imagine what a horrible tasting mess you would be left with if you tried to achieve a real red - my frosting ended up being inedible!"

The first time I tried to eat it, I took two bites and threw the rest of the can away.  The second time around, I only tried it because I could not believe it could possibly be as disgusting as I remembered.  It was.  That can and the rest of the cans ordered (cause, hey, this is a pack of 6) were thrown away immediately.

They liked them a lot when we bought them, but within a week both dogs had upset stomachs.

When we took her to the vet they could not attribute it to anything specific. When the older dog got sick a day after eating one of these we concluded it must be the bones. She has never been sick enough to warrant any medications before and we are putting her on medicine and prescription food to get over this. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

When I called customer service (they do not answer the phone, though they do call you back),  it took us days to actually connect. She insisted that this isn't a problem with the machine, it is a problem with the way it was handled when it was transported.  (???)  Umm... I'm pretty sure if this machine can't handle being shipped, then something is wrong with it.  I was then given directions to open up the machine and told that once I put the belt back on, it will work perfectly.  I couldn't open it up, but my father is an engineer and he opened it up and said that it appears to be very, very poor quality and he doesn't expect it will last long.  I spent $100 on this!

474422,Customer #1,1,"This sweetener is NOT from stevia. Natural stevia sweetener is a mixture of extracts of steviosides and rebaudioside-A from the leaves of several varieties of stevia plants and has been used and studied worldwide for decades and is classified ""generally regarded as safe"" by the FDA though some may not care for the taste.<br /><br />Truvia on the other hand is a Coca-Cola/Cargill partnership brand name for FAKE stevia sweetener; a mixture of .9% rebiana (not even an ingredient of steviana) and 99.1% erythritol sweetener derived from corn plants grown by Cargill, who have admitted that 30% of their corn is Genetically Modified. Regardless of the fact that the FDA is allowing this on the market, like many products these days this substance has not been properly tested and reviewed for negative or dangerous side effects of which many have already been reported by consumers of it.<br /><br />I will also be contacting Blue Sky Natural Beverage company about this unnatural ingredient in their ""100% natural, no calorie, no artificial sweetener"" sodas. Since my main goal in trying this soda with was to get away from genetically modified foods such as high fructose corn syrup and aspartame, I now do not trust Blue Sky enough to even try their regular sodas which they claim are made with ""real"" sugar, since nowadays that usually means a percentage of cane sugar mixed with sugar from genetically modified sugar beets. It is infuriating that companies like this can lie through their teeth to sell a phony product with no regard for the buyer and face no legal consequences."
370097,Wilma Jean,1,"I would not object if these had been labeled simply ""currants"" because Zante grapes are called currants in this country (the U.S.). However, Bob's Red Mill has unfortunately chosen to label these ""black currants"" which generally means Ribes nigrum. Luckily, I read the fine print at the last minute. Zante raisins (Vitis vinifera) are fine as raisins go, but they are not the antioxidant powerhouses that real currants are, and they do not have the complex flavor that the rest of the world associates with black currants. Bob's Red Mill ""black currants"" are probably better than most Zante raisins, but the label is misleading and it misrepresents the product. Bad call, Bob. I expect better from you."

So when I found this product on line in the single pot of coffee serving I was hopeful to find that same experience. However, when I opened the 1st wrapped pack it did not have that very fresh aroma. The coffee did not have the favor of the coffee when you open a new container, but rather tasted like the last remaining grounds of a nearly empty can of coffee. I have used 3 packages of this product and all taste the same. I'm sorry that I have the rest of this product to drink!"
33430,Phillip Morphis,1,"Yeah, yum.. If you like candied liquid smoke. I've never tried Walden Farm's before but the idea of 0 calorie, scratch that, *TRACE* calories and zero carbs. Wait, there's Splenda and it has half a carb per serving, plus tomato paste which also has carbs and other things on the ingredients that you can't de-carb.<br />Anyways, I digress, the idea of very little calories and very little carbs sounded too good to be true and yep. I drizzled it onto a grilled chicken wrap and bit in. Oh my god. The first thing to hit was a overly sweetness and not a real one, the chemical kind, bletch. The next thing to hit was a smokey taste, and again, not a very good one. It was way too strong and chemical tasting.<br />It ruined my wrap. I should have tasted it separately, but I thought for sure it couldn't be that bad, plus the taste of the Cajun seasonings on the chicken would help hide the taste. I was wrong. By the time I got to the end of the wrap where the liquid fool's gold had collected and bit through, it was way too much. I spit it out and threw the rest away. And all this from a small drizzle down the middle, after all, I was trying it.<br />I couldn't imagine pouring this on something and grilling that nastiness into it.<br />The other reviewers who gave it 5 stars. I don't know what they were thinking. Or maybe Walden Farm's changed the recipe but I didn't get spicy at all in this. It was a bottle of chemically candied chemical smoke flavor.<br />Absolutely horrid. I'd advise staying away unless you like wasting money, not just on this bottle of septic tank juices, but anything it touches. I must now to gargle Listerine and brush."

It's weird and strong.<br />It almost seems as if they use too much vanilla or they have some weird substitute flavoring in those teas.<br />I really like their Earl Grey tea-if you're into that.  But Stash makes that tea better.<br />I hope this helps.

398573,Dawn,1,"After comparing my own sense of what sweeteners taste best with that of others, I have concluded that there must be a genetic explanation for why some brands have an unpleasant aftertaste for certain people while being perfectly flavorless for others. I have a strong aversion to Sweet n Low because of what is for me a most unpleasant aftertaste, but I know that some people enjoy it.  Splenda and Equal have very little aftertaste for me, and blended in with other ingredients, I cannot detect any unpleasant taste from either, although I have friends who cannot stand to use them. Many years ago, I bought liquid Stevia sweetener, but the aftertaste, which to me had an anise flavor, was a turn-off. In the quest for a healthier sweetener, I decided to purchase a small box of Truvia, thinking that the powdered form might be more inviting.  Instead, it has the same disgusting bitter aftertaste that I remember from Sweet n Low. But like that sweetener, many people seem to enjoy Truvia and other Stevia products. If you aren't able to try just a sample of Truvia and therefore are considering spending your hard-earned cash on an entire box, then be aware before you buy that you may have taste buds like mine that can detect bitterness in this product."

84222,Serp,1,"I wanted to try these out because of the price and because it seemed to have solid reviews. I really like Slim Jims, and this looked similar and had good reviews.<br /><br />I didn't notice any mushiness that some people claimed. I thought it had a good snap to it, although you can definitely see where the casing is and the rest of the product, and sometimes it will just slide out a bit.<br /><br />I like the packaging. You can stick these into a big slider ziplock bag and it makes it far more convenient than any individually wrapped product, like Slim Jims are. I don't know how well it will keep that way, but I think it should be fine because, well, these products are pretty much designed to be kept like that. I don't know why some companies individually wrap theirs, maybe someone else can chime in on that.<br /><br />And now for the negative. Originally I tried to be more diplomatic with it, because I didn't want to dock stars for it not tasting like a Slim Jim. My brother absolutely hated the sticks and considers them disgusting. I held out that they weren't that bad, but after forcing myself to eat them the last few days I now give up.<br /><br />But worse is the ingredients. These things pack MSG. There is no nutritional label so we don't even know the percentage of it. But it is listed as an ingredient. Now it depends on you if that is a problem or not, for me personally I want to avoid MSG so this product doesn't work for me.<br /><br />I will likely throw away the rest of what I have. It is better to go for regular jerky, which can actually be healthy. These sticks are however a different product that you have to look at carefully, and for me the taste just isn't good enough to justify eating them."

411101,ollabarabolla,1,I could not get the Maple Grove Farms rasberry syrup so I decided to try their apricot syrup. It is<br />almost sickly sweet.  I could only recommend this syrup for those who have a strong sweet tooth. I never knew apricots were so sweet!

106601,speedy,1,I knew something was wrong when I opened the bag.  The beans had no shine or smell.  The coffee is worst than any off the shelf store brand and cost more.  I thought I could never taste a bad coffee until I bought this and now I have three bags! grrrr
109135,Alex,1,"I received the box, which contained--to my surprise--three spots with the rest spacers for the tomatoes. At a price of $19.95 (and I'm not that price sensitive), I thought this was seriously over priced. Worse, while two of the plants are well on their way, the third never sprouted. Did some investigation, and there were no seeds in the third. So, I basically paid $10 a tomato seed. As much as I love cherry tomatoes, and have loved other aero garden kits very much, I would not recommend this one."
113297,Jimmyfresno,1,"On the website, the Genco packaging labels this as Olive Pomace Oil. What arrived was labeled in small lettering on a stick-on label, ""Rape Pomace Oil,"" an oil made not only from rapeseed (canola) inferior oil, but from the leftover pomace of even that.  Although I bought this as a low quality oil acceptable for making olive oil soap, it is unsuitable even for that purpose.<br /><br />I was sadly misguided by all marketing sources leading me to this purchase. Please be careful, because this is priced almost equally with lower grade olive oils, which it is not."

54762,"lulu ""lulina""",1,"I ignored the other reviews for this oil, and purchased because I thought the price was good.  There were two things wrong. First, you will notice it says to put in hot water to melt the oil so you can get it out of the bottle.  This packaging is appropriate for warm weather locations.  Seattle is not a location that works for this product.  2.  The smell gagged me.  You do not want to put this product in your mouth.  I might use this on my hair, before washing it, but that is about it.  It stinks!  I have purchased other brands, from this website and from vitamin websites and they were cheap and lovely to the nose, mouth, and body.  I honestly do not know why this smells so bad. I have edited my review.  The reason I purchased this oil over others was that I thought that it was a bargain.  When I got the container I found that it was no cheaper and in fact more money than some oils I have been purchasing.  If you are using coconut oil for eating or putting on your body,  I urge you not to buy this oil.  It stinks really really bad, is no bargain and you cannot get it out of the container.  I should have returned it to amazon immediately upon receiving this."
565988,ant,1,"I'm not sure how a corn based diet got 5 stars from every one. before you purchase any dog food please identify all the ingredients and find out what they do to your dog. corn is really horrible for the coat and for the skin. go grain free, no fillers means better nutrition. better nutrition means they eat less, so in the long run those pricey foods that are grain free become cheaper. spend the extra money on food, not vet bills to figure out why you dogs itching so much or had skin problems. some good kibbles are, taste of the wild, evo, instinct, and the list goes on. if you don't want to spend that much you can go with canidae. if you really give two hoots about nutrition go with raw or freeze dry raw, or you could go with origin kibble which is nutritionally close to raw.

I bought this product specifically because I live abroad and needed a larger bottle and they offer this in 16 and 32 ounces.<br /><br />This product is very thick and tastes very strongly of chemicals.  I could barely get any vanilla flavor from it - and it makes my icings and frostings taste horrid.  The propylene glycol (not safe) just makes the product taste terrible.  It's listed as the second to last ingredient - but really - it just takes over any vanilla in the bottle.  And it comes out like glue into the measuring spoon and sticks!  Really a disappointment."

119379,itwasalvrstryst,1,"I bought these thinking they would be a slightly more productive treat for my 6yo, small, male cat. Usually I give him little pieces of plain fish or chicken, but was happy that there was something that might lessen how often I brush his teeth (since he hates it with a furry passion!).<br /><br />I gave him one thinking if he liked it I would give him more, but didn't want to confuse his system. After about 3 minutes, he threw up everywhere. More than once. I didn't want him to be sick, but he was so excited and had gobbled it up so fast I thought I would try the other flavor. Same thing after only one greenie. He's an EXTREMELY healthy cat, very active and has never had a single health problem, but these made him so sick. After he threw up he wouldn't eat for two days. I was going to take him to the vet, but he perked back up, and started eating normally (hasn't thrown up once since).<br /><br />Obviously it's not like this for every cat, but I looked into it further and if you read reviews from other major sellers there are many problems like this in perfectly healthy cats. Some reacted even worse than mine, so I was lucky."
177625,"John Britton Jr. ""mrbritton""",1,"The product description claims ""It contains no high-fructose corn syrup in regular flavors and no aspartame in diet flavors."" This is true - instead ALL of the 12 sample flavors we got with our machine contain SPLENDA (sucralose), whether ""diet"" or not! You have to read the fine print to discover this. Prior to reading the fine print, we tried the root beer: hmm, tastes like root beer but with an artificial after-taste. Then the ""Dr. Pepper"": hmm, tastes like Dr. Pepper but with an artificial after-taste. Checked the fine print: sugar, PLUS SPLENDA. Who would have thought the NON-diet flavors would contain SPLENDA? We threw the remaining 10 sample packs out and will look elsewhere for flavorings that don't sneak artificial sweeteners in - Monin syrups come to mind."

518921,P. Laird,1,"My wife and I have been drinking various Celestial Seasonings® teas for a long time, and have always found them to be excellent, flavorful blends. There is also a sense that the company's philosophy -- natural ingredients, healthy teas, sustainability, etc. -- gives consumers confidence that  consuming Celestial Seasonings® products will always be a satisfying and wholesome experience.<br /><br />That's how we felt... until today.<br /><br />A few days ago, I bought a new type of Celestial Seasonings® tea -- ""Sweet Harvest Pumpkin"" -- which I'd seen on display at the local Big Y supermarket. Knowing my wife has a liking for things pumpkin, I bought some. (I don't drink caffeinated tea anymore, so I wasn't going to try it.)<br /><br />Today my wife told me about the odd taste left in her mouth after she'd had a cup of the tea -- she said her mouth felt ""puckery"" after drinking it, and there was an unpleasant aftertaste which lingered even after she brushed her teeth. This experience prompted her to look at the list of ingredients on the box of tea... and to her surprise and dismay, she saw that one of the ingredients was ""stevia extract"".<br /><br />Stevia is a so-called ""natural sweetener"" derived from the Stevia plant. Here's what Wikipedia had to say about that plant:<br /><br />""The species Stevia rebaudiana, commonly known as sweetleaf, sweet leaf, sugarleaf, or simply stevia, is widely grown for its sweet leaves. As a sweetener and sugar substitute, stevia's taste has a slower onset and longer duration than that of sugar, although some of its extracts may have a bitter or licorice-like aftertaste at high concentrations.""<br /><br />I've tried a couple of drinks sweetened with Stevia... and I think they're vile. Worse than stuff sweetened with Saccharin or Aspartame, in my opinion... and they're pretty bad. That Celestial Seasonings® could think it was a good idea to put this wretched crap into their tea... well, it just boggles the mind. Not only that, they don't warn you that this junk is in the tea -- you have to read the fine print, and that's something I never expected to have to do with the products of this once-excellent company.<br /><br />As someone who gave up adding sweetener of any kind to his tea many years ago, I find it extremely offensive that Celestial Seasonings® has taken it upon themselves to sweeten their teas for us, especially with something as loathsome as Stevia. Really... do we need this? I don't think so. -- PL"
442381,"Sam ""panettonea""",1,"I bought this kit several months ago.  It was a lot of bother, and took about 2 months before it produced any mushrooms at all.  Then I got about 9 nice mushrooms--that's it.  Hardly 2-3 lb. as advertised.  It hasn't produced anything since, even though I've carefully followed all the directions.  A good mushroom kit should produce lots of mushrooms and also be easy and fun.  This kit is a dud.  Please don't even bother."
479753,JKJ,1,"I've been using the Vacu Vin for probably about as long as they've been making them, and still had a good one with plenty of stoppers before I bought this ""Concerto"" model.  I bought it because of the ""click"" the user is supposed to hear when the right amount of air has been pumped out of the wine bottle, for the obvious reason that I didn't want to keep pumping when there was no need to. The problem is that after using this model multiple times, I have yet to hear it click, so I might as well have just stayed with the older device I had.  Since this thing is apparently clicking away for most reviewers, my case is probably just an isolated one (or maybe in my advanced years I'm just not robust enough to pump to the click--though I'm skeptical that that's the problem)."

39925,Jen,1,"I wish I could give this food ZERO stars! It doesn't even deserve 1 star. I switched from wellness core to this food because I read an OLD review and critique of this food BEFORE P&G bought them. No grain, great limited ingredients, no red flag ingredients, all american product. However, since P&G(heartless, money grubbing, animal testing company that has a track record of ruining every quality pet food brand they buy) bought them they must have changed, at the very least, the quality of ingredients. My cat DOES NOT have a sensitive stomach/GI tract and has never had a reaction to any new food Ive given him. Two days after he started eating this his coat started feeling very coarse and he started having the WORST diarrhea and litterbox odor that filled my entire house. I feed him an entire bag of this stuff and instead of gradually getting better, his problems continually got worse. Towards the bottom of the bag it got to the point that his feces was so liquid, it would drip behind him through two rooms of the house! Gross I know, but I think others need to know how bad his problems were before they think of feeding this food to their babies. He is now on Orijen kibble and a frozen raw diet and the problems stopped the day after I switched him off this food. I believe at one time this was a quality food made by a quality company, but this is not the case anymore. Sad, but I think this food is now along the same lines as crud like meow mix and purina."

It also took over a week to arrive, when I paid for regular shipping.<br /><br />I tried this plain, with only water, and it was smooth enough to drink. Normally I drink it in lattes. With Culinary Teas brand, I had to add vanilla and sugar to the latte to make it palatable. Even though this costs more than Culinary Teas, it is worth it. I still add a bit of sugar to the latte though. The packaging is terrible, some form of hippie foil bag inside a cardboard box. Every time you spoon out some tea, it spills and powder gets everywhere. The inner bag is not resealable neither. I wish they came in larger sizes, with a resealable container."

148984,Heather Sue Waters,1,"I loved this product for about 4.5 months!  I used it to make batches of organic baby food several times each month and loved how easy it was to make healthy food for my daughter.  Occasionally I would notice dark particles in the lighter colored foods that I would make and just thought I was seeing bits of the skin from potatoes or carrots that I didn't peel with the greatest of care.  Two weeks ago, I noted a larger speck in the potatoes I was feeding my daughter and pulled it out.  It looked like a metallic flake.  I began to examine the machine and discovered that the interior coating of the water reservoir had begun to bubble up and was flaking off along the bottom of the tank!  I contacted the company asking for the chemical composition of the coating so that I may have my daughter tested, as I had no idea how much of this coating she had ingested over how long a period.  The company representative first said that there was no coating and that the tank was ceramic, so what I noted MUST be limescale build-up.  I am not unfamiliar with limescale, and absolutely know that THIS is not mineral deposits, but the actual darkish grey, metallic coating (underneath where the grey has flaked off, the reservoir is black).  I took pictures to send the company and spoke with other company representatives who finally admitted that yes, there WAS a coating and said they thought it was silicon-based over aluminum.  I asked again for the name of the compound and/ or the chemical make-up so that I could have my daughter appropriately examined.  They agreed to contact the company in China and get that information.  They called back days later and said that the Chinese company sent a letter saying that the ""silver coating""  was tested and FDA approved.  That's it.  I asked AGAIN for the chemical composition, and was told that it would take an additional 3 days to get it.  In three days, they called me back and said that the coating was a silicone material approved for food contact.  In other words, they reiterated EXACTLY THE SAME THING that they told me previously.  This company is STILL refusing to disclose what the interior reservoir is coated with and it has been two weeks since my initial request with them.<br /><br />The company claims that they have never received a complaint like this, so if anyone else out there has had this issue, I suggest that you contact Baby Brezza (1-888-396-6552) and let them know so that they can possibly recall this unsafe product.  The lot number on the bottom of my machine is WSI-030.<br /><br />Conclusion:  Though this is a great idea and saves you some time and hassle in the kitchen, I recommend skipping it and making your child's food the old fashioned way - steam it on the stove!"
26605,W. Zhang,1,"I bought one of the oatmeal from wholefood and fed it to my baby right away. I was happy about it because she loved it. But after a couple of weeks, one day when my Mom fixed the cereal, she asked me why it has the bad smell. I smelled it, and it does(it's not very strong but does has the smell like when all the nuts or rice turn bad)! I smelled the ""Earth's best"" one I have and it smells pefectly normal. Then I remembered I got a Happy Bellies multi-grain cereal before from [...]. It had not been opened and expires on March 2010. I opened it right away and it has a VERY strong bad smell. It makes me sick for several minutes and feel like there will be something fly out of it! I was really scared! You'd better be careful too since baby won't taste it and you may not find it before it's really bad! I feel so sorry for my baby since I know it's really bad to her health, much worse then giving her non-organic cereal. I won't ever buy the product again no matter how my baby likes it. It makes me really upset and I want to give it negative 5 starts if I could.<br />BTW, I submitted this reviw to [...] but they didn't publish it.

200332,Brian King,1,"We recently purchased the 2 lb. bag of Krusteaz Buttermilk Pancake Mix and when we received it the bag was sealed. While serving pancakes to my family I bit into some crunchy pieces and immediately thought ""oh I must have accidentally dropped an eggshell into the batter."" After biting into another crunchy bit and then getting a jab in my mouth it dawned on me (duh) that all I added was water. I immediately told the family to stop eating!  I investigated further to find large shards of glass in the pancakes (two of them 3/4 of an inch long).  The measuring cup that I used was metal and the only glass in the process was the mixing bowl which after careful examination revealed no signs of chipping and it wasn't broken - it was fully intact.  I poured a cup of the dry mix from the original bag into a sieve and found pieces of glass - including small chunks (1-2mm in size) as well as additional shards.  I then contacted Continental Mills (the company who makes Krusteaz) as well as the FDA.  Let me be clear on something - I have no interest in any sort of legal action - I simply wanted to be heard.  Other than that I suppose that I wanted to hear them apologize.  I thought that was fair especially after I just served glass to my 1, 3, and 7 year old courtesy of Continental Mills.  The FDA was great - saying that they log complaints like this in order to agglomerate data to look for trends. THEY even apologized that I had encountered that problem.  Continental Mills immediately told me that it was impossible for there to be glass in the mix but they would send me a packet to send the Krusteaz Buttermilk Pancake Mix back to them for analysis.  I just received the reply stating that they did in fact find glass in the mix but ""were unable to identify it as coming from our facility."" They also included a $0.30 off coupon for Krusteaz products. I find their response to be absolutely unacceptable.  I am left with the belief that they do not care about quality nor the safety of their customers.  The glass came from somewhere - either from their facility or one of the suppliers that provides them with salt, baking soda, etc...<br />I recommend that you avoid this product for your safety and the safety of your family."
189855,S. Lemen,1,"The Nutiva coconut oil was not moisturizing, which wasn't a surprise since oil doesn't moisturize, it just coats whatever you put it on. As such, once you moisturize your skin then apply coconut oil, this can help slow down the evaporation of the moisture into the air. That is great if you are less than 30 years old.  At 50+ I actually want and need moisture. I used this product faithfully for 6 weeks and all it did was smooth my legs for about an hour and then they were parched and dried looking again because I hadn't actually added moisture. My legs also felt greasy and had a faint odor of coconut. I don't really want a 2-step process of using a moisturizer on my legs then coating them with coconut oil.  As a face moisturizer it just made my face break out (yuuuuck!). As for the taste, I'll just say that butter has nothing to fear from this stuff. I really can't believe I fell for the hype and wasted my money with this purchase."

361574,P. Drew,1,"I love to bake, and I love Nestle Tollhouse, so this would be a great treat for bakesales or roadtrips, right?  NO.  I followed the instructions to make the muffin cup style.  As I was mixing the two batters, the brownie batter came out as dry and hard as paste.  I tried adding a little more water to at least make it mixable, but I still had to scrape it off the spatula and press it down into the muffin cups.<br /><br />The cookie mix - well the instructions said it would be dry & crumbly at one point, but mine never progressed off of dry & crumbly.  Since both the brownie & cookie batters were so dry, I figured that this must be intentional, and that somehow it would magically resolve itself via baking.<br /><br />The muffin pans were thoroughly greased with shortening (not spray), and the ""brownie blob with chocolate chip streusel topping"" went into the oven.<br /><br />When they came out, they looked great, but they were not coming out of the cups.  I tried loosening them with my trusty loosening spoon, then a butter knife, but they were permanently adhered to the pans (even after leaving them overnight in sheer desperation).<br /><br />The pieces I managed to pry out of the pans just didn't taste good, either.  I had such high hopes for this product, but ended up having to chuck the pans into the trash and buy new ones.  It's a great concept, and I may try to come up with my own version using regular brownie mix and ""I measured & mixed it myself"" Toll House cookie dough.  What a bummer."

There is so much ginger in this that it actually made my tongue burn and I only used a half of packet. I can't imagine the burning sensation if I would of used an entire packet of this stuff.  It also leaves a nasty bitter aftertaste in my mouth. I took one sip of this and that is all I could take of it. I wanted to like this drink but it's just not for me.<br /><br />The only good things I can say about Gold Kili beverage is that it's an instant drink and it mixes up really well in your glass.

This is because the roast intensity of the coffee is between light and medium, so the coffee looks brown (rather than dark).

21920,"JollyMolly7 ""JollyMolly7""",1,"I worked with my dogs on this toy for several days. Using it as an interactive toy we played tug, and the rubber stopper became wedged tightly so that it sealed the hole, trapping the kibble inside. The goodies inside would only fall out when the rubber stopper and straw was in a very specific position, AND the straw-like piece had grabbed the treat and pulled it through the hole, AND the bottle had to be upside down. This was something that my dogs could not possibly do with their mouth, tongue, and feet. They would pick it up by the rubbery end, sniffing and chewing at the rubbery purple parts, making it impossible to use gravity to allow the tiny treats to fall out, let alone accomplish the amazing ""straw grabber"" feat described above. Of course with no reward the motivation waned. Even my highly intelligent dog got frustrated and then became indifferent. After I had left the room for 10 minutes, my other dog had chewed up the purple rubber stopper and straw, and transformed the already useless toy into just a bottle with a small hole and no rubber stopper. Don't waste your money. I'm not impressed with the other two toys (by this maker) that I bought: busy bouncy bone, and busy bristle bone. (see my other reviews)"

I was using it every week to make a surplus of baby food to feed my daughter throughout the week.  I properly descale it with vinegar regularly, and follow instructions for water amounts.  Then, about a month ago I noticed that when I steamed the food there would be a puddle of water that formed underneath the mixer on the counter.  This worried me a bit because I'm not a huge fan of electrical appliances sitting in puddles of water!  I tried to tighten the blade so that it wouldn't leak, but no use.  I contacted the company, and they told me I needed a new rubber gasket which forms the seal around the blade hole.  I ordered one, and after I replaced the old gasket it worked fine for one steam, but then the very next time I used it the thing leaked again!  I ordered a five pack of the rubber gaskets, thinking that if I'm going to continue to use this thing I'll have to replace the gasket every time (absurd, but I really liked the product).  Well, I put in a new gasket, and it STILL leaked!  So now I'm left with a package of gaskets and a leaky baby food maker.

198181,MJ23447,1,"For starters this lid does not fit.  It is supposed to be held on by two little ""bumps"" on the edge of the lid but they are not flared out far enough.  The end result is that the lid easily falls off.<br /><br />Further, the quality of the ceramic glaze is terrible.  There are several spots on my piece where the glaze was missed and the raw porcelain shows through.<br /><br />Contrary to other reviewers, the water drips though WAY too fast.  When i make a single cup the water is fully through the cone in less than 30 seconds.  This is far too fast given that coffee should ideally steep in the water for 1.5 to 2 minutes.<br /><br />The handles are also thin and flimsy.  They look like they would easily snap off.  Lastly, this item is made in China so I'm concerned about the lead content of the glaze used.  Given the shoddy overall quality I would not be surprised if they were also careless about what went into the glaze materials.  Do yourself a favor and find something made in Japan."

I would give this zero stars if I could.  WOW, likely the worst cup of coffee that I have ever had.  I hope Wolfy reads this as his name is on the package and I expected more, now I know not to buy any of his signature products, awesome, thanks for saving me $$ next time!

560251,amyjo,1,"I absolutely love this cat food. Since my cats have been on it the change in their coats is remarkable.  They also leave way less solids in the cat box since there is no corn in it.  It is great for cats with urinary tract issues as well.  My complaint is the price they have listed....RIDICULOUS!  At a local pet store I pay $35 for the 12 pound bag and even Petco, which is listed in the ad has it cheaper."
375315,lawgirl,1,"I've never found an Amy's soup I didn't like...until now. I thought I'd try something new and from the description this seemed tasty, but that was not the case. First of all, the soup was incredibly thin. Most of Amy's soups are thicker & heartier. Secondly, there were a couple of large leaves in the soup (couldn't deduce what they are from the ingredient list) that would've been better off left out of the finished product. Thirdly, the pieces of tofu in the soup are miniscule and tasteless - hardly worth inclusion. Lastly, the taste of the soup made it nearly inedible for me. The combination of the overpowering lemongrass with the coconut milk combined to make something that tasted a lot like what I imagine dish soap to taste like. I will NOT be purchasing this soup ever again. And while I am thrilled that a company like Amy's offers so many great vegan options, I won't be recommending this to my vegan friends either."
56142,L. Beeler,1,"Updated:  I purchased Tilda Basmati because of the rave reviews, WOW whats not to like about getting an even better basmati flavor?  This bag of basmati rice was packaged well, packed well for shipping, and shipped promptly.  But the rice itself is very disappointing.  It's instant rice, and not very good instant rice at that, with a basmati flavor.  It cooks in ten minutes to a mushy pasty individual grain.<br />  What with having ten pounds of it, I've tried cooking it every way that rice can be cooked, just in case I was preparing it incorrectly. Nope, tastes like someone made rice mush and then extruded it thru small holes and re-dried it. My family and I enjoy whole grain rices that generally take 55 minutes to cook and allow you to have a pleasant flavor and distinct individual grain texture to the mouth. I even tried using it as a filler for meat loaf or meat balls. It decreases the quality of any recipe you use it in.<br />  The only explanation for all these rave reviews that I can see is that they're generated by the company, or that the purchasers have never tasted real rice before.  This stuff is awful.  After a year of holding it in my refrigerator, much to long to get a refund, I've just finished dumping 9 1/2 pounds of it in the trash."
173673,T. Bates,1,"If you live in Scotland, perhaps these are delicious. Here, I would not label them ""cookies"", but maybe crackers. Imagine a densely-packed wafer of oat bran. Hard, brown and with the flavor of cardboard, (or maybe presto-board) and you have these ""cookies"". :  I don't know where the chocolate is. I don't know where the calories come in, either. One word: nasty! If I could return these, I would. They are also in very small 7 oz. boxes. Well, they say ""live and learn"". I have learned I do not like these!"
381655,Artemus Engle,1,I HATE TO SAY IT BUT THIS CANDY IS HORRIBLE. IT IS TASTELESS AND IN-EDIBLE. I TRIED IT AND THREW THE ENTIRE 2LB BAG AWAY.

104313,Cydona,1,This review is actually written in Sept of 2011. The original was a glowing review but apparently I'm not allowed to review the same product twice. Really Amazon? This jerky used to be so good and now it's the weirdest ever. The packaging that used to be so easy to open is now impossible without scissors. The jerky itself is like squares of hard rubber that are nearly impossible to chew.I bought my usual boxes of original and teriaki and the flavors were almost identical. After years of being a fan (especially my husband who doesn't eat beef)I'm so disappointed in whoever is responsible for destroying a great product. To whoever designed the new packaging....you need to go back to the drawing board. How about the original? It was perfect on all counts as it was. From 5 stars to 1. Barely.

The manufacturer's rep in L.A. told me that it is supposed to be refrigerated or the cultures ""bloom"" early and then don't work to make yogurt.  Well, the product is not sold nor warehoused under refrigeration, so who would have guessed?  The package does say ""store refrigerated"" but why the end-user only?  Could it possibly have ""bloomed"" before purchase?  The company does not stand behind the product for direct purchase; if  you are going to buy it, go to a retail store where you can return products that don't work.  I now use store-purchased natural yogurt for my starter, a bit of a pain, but no failures."

That product is $1.59/pound at the time of this review. These are the first four ingredients:<br /><br />Bison, venison, lamb meal, chicken meal<br /><br />Iams lists corn, a grain, and a meat by-product within the first four ingredients. Compare that to Taste of the Wild, which lists bison, venison, lamb meal, and chicken meal. ALL meats, and no by-products. Taste of the Wild is the far superior option. Healthier, more natural ingredients to a dog's diet, and cheaper. Make the correct decision, both for yourself and your dog."

148961,rudybrew,1,"I was using this baby food maker for 2 months and I loved it. It was so easy to steam the food and then puree it in one machine. I used it almost every day and raved about it to friends. However, last week I noticed a small amount of black smudge on the drive shaft when I went to clean it. I really didn't think anything of it or I thought that it was from the banana I pureed because it had a bruise. Today I made a large batch of food and when I was done and went to clean the machine the entire drive shaft was coated with the black liquid. I now know that the black stuff is lubricating oil. Needless to say dumped the batch of food. I am so upset because I don't know if the oil got into any of my baby's past food. I had ordered it from One Step Ahead and they are giving me a full refund plus an extra $25 for my troubles. They tried to act like this was the first they've heard of this problem but I don't buy it. At least 15 other people on Amazon have complained of the same thing. Ugh. Don't take a chance on this one!"

134537,pullthetab,1,"I must admit these do work for getting your pets to take pills - 2 very finicky dogs who almost always spit out their pills in any food did scarf their pills down when put in these.  However, after only 2 pills (separated by 8 hours), one of my dogs (8 month old puppy) became violently ill about 2 hours after the 2nd pill pocket with numerous episodes of explosive diarrhea and vomiting (ultimately very bloody after 12 hours).  It ended up costing us money for a vet visit and medicine to get the dog to get well, and a major scare that the puppy was going to die (could hardly move after 18 hrs of this).  The medicine was not new, nor any thing else changed, so I presume it was due to these (certainly not going to try them again to see).  Our other dog (full adult) did fine, however.  Maybe it should just not be used for puppies, or maybe it's just an unusual reaction, but if you google ""pill pockets diarrhea"", you will see this is an occasional known side effect.<br />Would suggest trying just one of these each of the first few days to make sure your pet is not intolerant of these. 1 out of 2 for me was not good odds."

Every time I have drank the tea, I get a pain in my diaphragm like I have to burp but can't. I thought it was something I ate so I tested the theory. I quit drinking the tea and felt okay, I have drank the tea every few days without changing anything else in my diet, and every time I have drank the tea the same thing occurs.<br /><br />Not sure if this has happened to anyone else while drinking this brand. I probably should buy some other Pu erh and try it but I'm a little hesitant now."
44932,"Betty Lou ""Alto1962""",1,I have very healthy 45 year old teeth and one bowl of this cereal was enough to break a large chuck off one of my teeth.  Be careful as I never expected to find gravel hard chunks in my bowl of breakfast cereal.  I am just sickened by it since I do take such pride in my teeth and to make matters worst its a front tooth!  If you don't like to chew gravel for breakfast then you likely won't enjoy this cereal.  Yeah it taste pretty good and may be healthy for you but not worth breaking your teeth over.  We won't even talk about denist bills.  Notice I am not the only review about broken teeth from this cereal.  The chunk broke off my tooth is at least the size of a average size pea so not just a tiny little salt grain.  If you like your teeth stay away from this cereal!  Ezekiel Almond Cereal
50901,L. Niles,1,"This stuff is pretty nasty. I live in a household with two cats. I supplement their diets with wet food and thought I'd make the change to a organic brand.<br /><br />First of all, this stuff turned my stomach upon opening it. It smells disgusting, like something died in the can. The consistency was gross too. This stuff was sloppy and fibrous. It looked like spoiled tuna salad and smelt even worse. I thought it had possibly gone bad but the date on the can indicates that it's still quite good and nowhere near the expiration date.<br /><br />I really shouldn't have given this to my cat but I gave him a portion of it (not the whole can) to see how he took to it. He actually did eat it very happily, gluttonously in fact... But he was ill after and the remnants of this come up all over the kitchen floor. That's the first time I've ever had this happen when sampling a new food.<br /><br />I think I'm going to stick to my usual brand. This stuff was not worth it! I am very disappointed and quite disgusted."

It is mainly large thick noodles with a few peas and pieces of carrot.  it is listed as having 15 grams of protein, but has little of anythiing else except for salt.  It indicates 990 mg of salt.

380665,duckiec,1,"I guess I should have paid more attention to the other reviews- these have a really odd taste and an even worse aftertaste- I agree with another person who said they tasted like they were fried in rancid oil.  My kids love freeze-dried bananas (used to be able to get them at Trader Joes, but haven't seen them in awhile) as well as the apples, peaches, pineapples, etc.  So they are not strangers to dried fruits, and usually like them.  These- not so much. My 18-mo old who usually eats anything turned them down- that's saying something! I'm still trying to get the taste out of my mouth, its just not right; the acai (which I know I've had in other things and have liked just fine) totally takes over the banana and aside from the texture, you wouldn't know it's banana in there.  Now I've got 11 bags that will be going in the trash, and that's $12.00 I won't get back. Bummer.  Other flavors (I also ordered Purple Pinapple and had the Carnival Mix) are yummy, but this one just is too funky for this family."

73861,L. Siskiyou,1,"I'm a user of liquid stevia and i was looking for something i could use for baking.  The sweetener never dissolves with the wet ingredients, and, when your baking cools off, you have crunchy crystals of this sweetener in your baking. I even tried dissolving it first by warming up the wet ingredients, it appeared to dissolve, but after cooling i got the same results.  The other reviewers say that you tune into the taste in order to taste it.  I agree, if you use too little, it does not sweeten (you can't taste it), and if you use enough to taste it, you've ruined what you are trying to sweeten with it's nasty tin foil taste.  Dont bother using it for coffee or tea, because it sinks to the bottom of the cup because it does not completely dissolve even in hot water.  I should also mention that its not sweet in the slightest bit.  And i've been off sugar for years, so it's not because i'm used to real sugar.<br /><br />Bleh."

326389,arcanax,1,"very disappointed with this brand and was indeed shocked to see some of the raving reviews turn out to be sooo wrong. Makes me want to believe that reviews are not really written by real people. Where can I start? it is a very dry and bland recipe with no taste, that did not cook right at all. We used to purchase and cook Flappin Jack Pancakes, and it was wonderful. This thing just tasted downright horribly bland. Our first attempt of following directions and using Buttermilk yielded nothing shy of gross pancakes - we tried it with regular milk and butter and that was not much better. I am sad to say that I bought 3 of these and should have never wasted my money. So, if you like fluffy, buttery taste pancakes that melts in your mouth, do not waste money on this piece of junk recipe."
451602,Scott,1,Only after I purchased this and opened it did I see 'Product of China'. They do not have to adhere to American food safety standards in China. BUY SOMETHING ELSE.<br /><br />I would rate this no stars but Amazon won't allow that.

225487,Blythe Dresser,1,"I don't know how what I tried could be considered the same as what all the rave reviews are coming in for.<br /><br />When we got our new Keurig brewer for Christmas it came with a sample pack of 12 different coffees. We were excited for the opportunity to try different blends before purchasing an entire (pricey) box of any one flavor.<br /><br />To preface: I enjoy flavored coffees. French vanilla, mocha, hazelnut... Pretty much any variety available. I was really excited to try Gloria Jean's Hazelnut since it was one of the few flavored options in the sample pack. I typically enjoy smooth medium roasts and I can't stand bitter coffee with a pungent aftertaste.<br /><br />Unfortunately, though, this brew is without-a-doubt undrinkable. So bitter and thick. I couldn't believe this was supposed to be a flavored blend. It smelled burnt as soon as it was brewed. We brewed an 8 ounce cup since typically flavored coffees tend to be weaker so we assumed brewing the smaller size cup would allow us to enjoy to most flavor. The coffee was dark in appearance and both my boyfriend and I tried it befor dumping it out in the sink because the taste was so foul.<br /><br />Aside from its burnt flavor and bitter aftertaste, it's also worth mentioning that I couldn't detect any hazelnut notes at all. Very disappointing.<br /><br />I'd never tried a Gloria Jean brand coffee before and now I'm nervous to try another. I might attempt the Butter Toffee flavor if I can find it in a small pack. But I'll avoid hazelnut from now on."

The jam jelled, all right, but the final consistency was pasty and the brightness of the fruit flavors was totally clouded.  I got pretty much the same results as if I'd thickened my fruit with corn starch.  Ick!  Next time I'll stick with Sure-Jell."

Gevalia sells in markets in Sweden for between 19 and 29 Swedish Crowns, that is, between $2.32 and $3.65 for a half/kilo package, a bit more than a pound. It's the Folgers of Sweden, an average coffee at best. Idiot Americans are willing to pay 6 times the going rate out of sheer lunacy.<br /><br />My wife and I have a second home in Sweden and drink Gevalia there, but it's cheap coffee.

But wanted a healthy soup to add to my brown rice.<br /><br />After putting it in the microwave for 3 minutes, which is what I always do with soups, it came out looking like mush and tasted like it also. I have 11 more cans to go through though so bought some hot sauce, going to try chili powder and pepper.  As for the looks, I don't mind so much if it fills me up and healthy for me.<br /><br />The lack of flavor and having to find things to add to it makes it not worth the cost for me.  The killer is, out of the 12 pack, a single can wasn't dented.  The packaging was fine so I doubt they were damaged when shipped.  I also ordered the chicken noodle soup from the same brand, but I haven't tried that yet.  Same problem with the denting.<br /><br />Would I recommend?  Nope.

197250,"R. P. Poletti ""Just a guy""",1,"Is there any actual yeast in this? I have used this many times from several different batches and purchased from different retailers at different times. It often comes prepacked as the yeast in pre-packaged bread mixes.  Each time I was careful to make sure that it was nowhere near the expiration date. In EVERY case, the bread has failed to rise. This is worse than garbage as it ruins all the ingredients and you have to throw it all out; there is little worse than needlessly wasting food.  When it comes with the pre-packaged mixes, I have tried throwing out this branded ""yeast"" packet and replaced it with other brands of yeast.  When I do this, the bread comes out perfectly.  The bread is only ruined if I actually used this brand of yeast.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you want to be disappointed and waste time, energy, money and food, then this is exactly what you want.<br /><br />Update May 2012:<br /><br />I have been experimenting with this brand of yeast by trying to activate in the following manner. Take one packet (about two teaspoons), add 1/4 teaspoon of sugar and 1/4 cup of water between 110 and 120 degrees. Put it in a coffee cup and get it all nice and wet and wait about five minutes. Red Star brand and Fleischmans (regular and fast rising) and the Hodgson Mill yeast in their bread machine mixes (the only other ones I have checked) yeast will rise and fill half the coffee mug. (Fast risers fill the whole cup) This brands increases its volume by just a little.<br /><br />I have also found that Red Star (regular, did not try the fast rise) yeast that is more than one year past its expiration date performs nearly as well as the fresh stuff. Therefore I can say with the confidence of empirical evidence that Red Star yeast that is more than one year past the expiration on the package performs better (read: acceptable) than the packets of unexpired SAF yeast I have tried (read: unacceptable)."

And you think this is food? No wonder America is the most obese country in the world."

54050,Matthew Wolfe,1,"The best thing about this gum is the packaging.<br /><br />Where to begin on what is wrong with this gum? About 30 seconds after the start of chewing, the flavor is gone. The gum devolves to chewing flavorless cud. Each piece of gum quickly reduces to nothingness while chewing. I had to chew about three to four pieces just to have an approximate equivalent to a ""normal"" piece of gum. If there's any benefit to the all-natural ingredients, I don't know what they are. It's not like the gum is being digested and absorbed.<br /><br />I won't make the mistake of buying Glee gum again."
487892,"Blaze Jericho ""Beretorn""",1,"I almost have tears in my eyes as I type the Truth.  PLEASE READ Before Buying, these were the best Organic based cookies...  Now they should be avoided by all who value quality.  Newman was a Great man, when he was alive the company was better... Since his death they have destroyed their best products by replacing the key organic ingredients w/ non Organic ones.  These cookies used to break apart great, often w/ a circle of chocolate... Now when you break them apart, the chocolate looks like what sticks to rear before wiping.  Nasty taste/texture, its not creamy, broken bits of chocolate.  I got very sick after eating these, causing me many issues trying to do number 2.  I'm considering a refund since I was dumb enough to buy 6 of them... There were no warning or notice that the formula had changed... I had just got them a few months prior so didn't expect anything different.  Please believe there is a huge difference w/ how body handles Organic Chocolate/Coca compared to non organic.  Sadly this is another product the Newman's company has made unconsumable.  It shows that companies do not respect consumer enough to have the main or key ingredients Organic.  For example if you get Organic cinnamon, ginger, cocoa, or chocolate cookies it should be Organic... Not made from Organic Wheat while the named ingredients are non organic unknown chemicals etc.  I'll continue to use their products for my dogs until those are ruined too.  Please realize the positive reviews are for a changed product... You will not receive the 5 star cookies people raved about... Instead there is just the 1 star non Organic Cocoa & Chocolate ones."

To my dismay, the package that came in the mail has changed. The picture on Amazon still shows my favorite brand, but apparently Jim Beam seeds are now being produced by ""BIGS"". They changed the seed, as well as the amount of seasoning. The taste is the same, but not nearly as strong.<br /><br />Just a shame. The genuine original seeds were perfect. It wasn't just the taste, but the amount of flavor, as well as the quality of the seeds. Now we just have something simliar to a regular store-bought brand.<br /><br />I contacted Jim Beam and they verified they no longer have genuine seeds. They are all BIGS now, so my seed buying days on Amazon are over. I might as well go back to Davids or some generic brand from the grocery store."

202503,Robert E. Howe,1,"The bag I received contained 8 oz. of tea, not the advertised 16 oz.  This is the reason it now sells for $24 when it used to sell for $48.  The manufacturer's label on the bag said it held one pound, but the bag was not physically large enough to accommodate that much tea.  Amazon gave me the option to accept half of my money back, which I went for.<br /><br />I might also note that the glossy-finish bag appeared to have been well worn.  It looked like it had been reused many times.<br /><br />Regarding the stems that another reviewer mentioned, over the years I have purchased Pearl Jasmine from three other suppliers (Numi, TeaSpring, SeattleTeaCup.com).  All of them looked like this.  With Davidson's product I actually noticed much shorter stems attached to the leaves than with other Jasmine teas, and the leaves were larger.  I also noticed that the pearls are slightly smaller than what I have purchased from other suppliers.<br /><br />The aroma from the open bag was pleasant and similar to what I have experienced with other suppliers' products.  The taste is another matter.  I brewed a cup and found a bitter taste not observed with any of the other brands.  Tea from other suppliers has always offered a pleasant aroma and taste that makes Pearl Jasmine worth the extra cost.  These are sadly lacking in Davidson's product.  I do not recommend it."
84645,Dotchi Latham,1,"I bought this thinking it would be nice to eat a spaghetti that was gluten free and not expensive. I bought a few packages because I always follow the package directions first, then I play with it if it's not to my liking.<br /><br />Attempt 1 was like eating a gummy spaghetti noodle with a nasty after taste. I had to add sauce and butter to kill the taste.<br /><br />Attempt 2 wasn't any better. It was still gummy and gluey like and the flavor wasn't very good either.<br /><br />Attempt 3 was a little better in that the water didn't look like a gelatin style mess when we drained it but the noodles were chewy and I couldn't finish the second bite.<br /><br />Attempt 4 was when I finally said no more ""pasta joy"". I ended up trying to cook it by breaking the noodles in half first, thinking maybe it just isn't that great for cooking as long noodles. Oh no. I ended up having to take out clumps of noodles, tear them apart from each other and put them back in the pot. I gave up towards the end and just threw the clumps of noodles out. The texture was slimy, gummy and sticky and the aftertaste is still like pet food.<br /><br />If you are used to over cooked spaghetti drowned in sauce, I could see how this would be great... But if you want something that tastes and acts like spaghetti, this is NOT it.<br /><br />I can't figure out how this got 5 stars. It was horrible in taste and texture and was nothing close to spaghetti. I bought Hodgkins Mills rice and flaxseed noodles and they are perfect in texture and taste. But I won't buy pasta joy again."

148967,Sarah Hagans,1,"I am so disappointed in this product. It broke the fourth time I used it and the warranty still requires me to pay $10 to have it fixed or replaced (which especially stinks given that this was a gift). It purees food okay, but not as finely as my food processor, and I think that is really sad considering it's the primary job of this machine. Also, it leaves too much liquid in the chamber after steaming, and made my puree too thin.  I had to start draining water before pureeing my food, which is a pain.<br /><br />And to add insult to injury, the metallic chamber where the water reserve lives, it somehow affected the taste of the water and made my fruits taste metallic. The steamer feature would be nice if it didn't make the food taste funny.  No sense in making organic baby food yourself if your child won't eat it due to the aftertaste.<br /><br />I'm so bummed as I had high hopes for this machine.  I recommend you get a food processor instead- it will work better for baby foods, and you'll get more mileage out of it."

It consists of a bowl of very watery gravy with a sliver of dry, stringy beef, a few small chunks of potatoes, and a few slivers of carrots.  It's a rip-off, in other words.  When a company sinks to the point of having to cheap out so badly on low-cost filler foods like potatoes and carrots, that's pretty pathetic.<br /><br />The product doesn't taste good, either; it also has a weird vinegary flavor, and is far too salty.  Salty as in teetering on inedible.<br /><br />To avoid wasting mine, I am adding dehydrated vegetables to try to make this product edible, and that's just barely working.  I hate to waste food, so I will probably donate these rather than throw them out, in the hope that the recipients might find them useful.  I live in the South now, where many people seem to like very salty foods.<br /><br />I've tried a number of low-end convenience products, even though obviously like everyone else I'd always prefer to eat fresh halibut and bison steaks etc.  I'm not blind to the benefits of products like these, and have been trying some as an experiment.  I don't see any reason why such products couldn't be great; but usually they aren't that hot, if at least passable for their purpose.  But this one is truly bad.

95505,"Gregory L. Pease ""glpease""",1,"Frankly, this isn't worth the bottle it's put in. Heinz have really screwed the pooch on a wonderful, traditional product. Not only were the sugars replaced by HFCS, but the wonderful malt vinegar has been substituted with a more generic (read: cheaper) distilled vinegar. These two things alone result in a product that not only lacks the subtlety and spice of the original, but one that leaves a nasty, cloying aftertaste. I'n not even going to get into the potential health risks of HFCS--if the stuff tasted good, I probably wouldn't care, considering the small amount used. But, it does NOT taste good, and as a life-long Lea & Perrins devotee, I feel completely ripped off by Heinz's cost-cutting measures. Maybe some people can't tell the difference, but I'm betting a lot more can.<br /><br />My question to Heinz would be, why the hell buy a company, just to completely ruin up its flagship product? Or, is it that they didn't want competition for their third-rate ""Worcestershire sauce?"" Now that I think about it, the new L&P tastes a lot like the rubbish in the Heinz bottle. Maybe one and the same? Gak.<br /><br />Fortunately, as others have mentioned, you can still get something that more closely resembles the real thing from both Europe and Canada. Do your homework.

467498,"Zwee ""Just Zwee""",1,"I'm afraid, after reading the other reviews, that perhaps I may have purchased a 'bad batch' or something (I purchased from Costco like one of the other reviewers) as I absolutely did not like this product at all.<br /><br />I love quinoa, brown rice & quinoa/rice blends. I love garlic and lots of it. Raw, baked, paste, confit in oil...you name it. This, sadly, wasn't rice/quinoa/garlic as I know it.<br /><br />-First off, the blend doesn't quite look like it shows on the package, of course. The colours are more drab and khaki-hued. Yummy! There's also not nearly as much quinoa in the package as there appears to be in the picture. I normally expect packaging to be misleading but in the picture it looks like roughly 60/40 or 50/50 rice:quinoa. In real life, it's more like 90/10...MAYBE 75/25 if you want to be generous.<br /><br />-Secondly, whatever Seeds of Change did to the 'garlic' in this stuff shouldn't happen to a hardened criminal! The smell is unbearable. Pungent, cloying and slightly sour. Very unappetising. Mixed with the drab colour of the final cooked product, it doesn't really put it's best foot forward if you know what I mean. Just by the smell and look alone, I was already losing my appetite, and I was *quite* hungry when we prepared this. Great if you're on a diet, I suppose...<br /><br />-It tastes as bad as it smells, but fortunately not as cloying. There is no depth of flavour, so the taste doesn't really linger long on the tongue. This is actually in the 'Pro' column since the taste is dreadful. Flat, cardboard-like, faintly acrid, and the only thing vaguely resembling garlic is the aftertaste and smell it leaves on your breath. When there's more aftertaste than initial taste, that's never a good sign. It's as if they took immature garlic, slightly burnt it, dehydrated it, pulverised it to a fine powder and threw it in the package as an afterthought. VERY disappointing as I've had other Seeds of Change products and liked them quite a bit!<br /><br />-I *will* say that they did a great job on the texture. The texture was very nice, just the right kind of 'al dente' that I like. This, regrettably, put all the other defects of the product into sharper relief. If only it didn't taste terrible!<br /><br />-You might be able to doctor this product up with some sort of sauce or extra seasonings but 1)that could be risking making it worse and 2)why would you waste the time and effort. Simply buy something else.<br /><br />But, please, do yourself a favour and don't buy this."

We started SCD/GAPS to deal with lingering health problems caused by eating a regular GF diet for our Celiacs.  I bought 2 different brands of almond flour, one made specifically for and by SCD and BRM.  We used up the other brand and started using the BRM and guess what?  ALL symptoms of Celiac started coming back!!  Doing an Internet search I did find out that many Celiac's not only react badly to BRM almond flour, but to many other of BRM GF items too.  Before SCD, we had stopped using any BRM GF baking products because we always got 'gluten sick ' from them.  We will NEVER use another  GF flour from BRM again because their food safety is just not strict enough.  I did get a prompt refund from BRM for the $125 I spent on the 25lb box of almond flour though."

It also irritates my throat for some reason, in fact at first I thought I was having some kind of reaction, but it has subsided since I've started writing this review.<br /><br />Like everyone else is saying, this 'protein' shake doesn't have much protein.

The chunky, thick mealy consistency changed to a standard pate. After using this product for a year, it suddenly was different. I didn't tell my cats about it, and just fed them the same as always. They tried, boy they really tried to like it, even switching to each others' dish several times, but they wouldn't do anything more than move it around. That was a dinner - I ended up just giving them dry food. So for breakfast, I tried again, same results, only this time, I heard about it! So, I give this product one star, way down from 4.5 before.

Sugar is a major ingredient as well as some type of added oil which I assume keeps the naturally occurring peanut oil in suspension (i.e., you don't have to stir this one to mix the peanut oil back into the peanut butter). Sugar may make this more appealling to the kiddie set, however.  If you are mixing true ""natural"" peanut butter, try using a hand mixer with a single blade; hold the jar tight, and mix away and in 30 seconds you're finished (unless you didn't grip the jar tightly enough, in which case you have to clean the kitchen, too)."

148938,OCMom,1,"My Baby Brezza journey is so disheatening that I have to share. I did extensive research into baby food maker and as most of you who are reading this, I narrowed it down to the Brezza and the Beaba. Brezza won me over with the one button touch and step away function. So....<br /><br />November 2011: Bought Baby Brezza on cyber monday sale (was around 100 bucks), arrived 2 weeks later -- dead on arrival. Plugged it in, no light, no function, nothing. Thankfully, my baby wasn't quite eating yet. Called Baby Brezza/emailed, a few days later a new machine came out to me.<br />Jan - March 2012: Brezza #2 working well, around the end of March, started seeing a black oiling residue. I'm a pretty chill mom, so just wiped it off and soldiered on.<br />April 2012: Brezza #2 stopped working, steams fine, but will NOT blend, can hear the motor, but no action. Called Customer service, again a few days to connect up. The agent said there was an old batch of shafts that have caused problems, will send new shaft -- a few weeks later a new Brezza showed up.<br />May 2012: On to Brezza #3, plugged it, made applesauce, take extra care regarding the shaft (purported to be new and awesome). Brezza #3 stopped working 10 hours after arrival (2 batches of baby food). Called customer service, no answer, called again, left a VM, called again, spoke to a very apologetic lady who states she will send out another new shaft and as compensation for all the inconvenience an accessory of my choice. Per her, it should arrive within 4-5 days.<br />June 2012: still waiting, almost 14 days later, placed another call to customer service.<br /><br />So my advice.<br /><br />1. didn't save money (need to have jarred baby food on hand in case your Brezza busts)<br />2. went through 3 units in 5 months<br />3. Spent A LOT of time tracking down Baby Brezza customer service.<br />4. Have a lot of spare Brezza parts in my house.<br /><br />If you were thinking about buying, consider getting it at the big box store so when it busts you can just return it and get your money back and lessen the anger and frustration at this product.<br /><br />Cheers, hope it helps. Thankfully, as we rarely had a working baby food machine, my daughter quickly graduated to mushed up food and small bites and grew out of the baby food phase... still such a bummer, what a poor made product."
240369,"Michigoon ""tech geek""",1,"We picked this up as a sometime-treat for our dog. We definitely will not be using this as the main food for her and I'll tell you why. If you note in the ingredients, the very first item listed is corn, which is NOT good for animals. It is a filler and isn't nutritious for them at all. The first ingredient in any good food should be meat, and corn should definitely not be in the top 5, let alone the first item. The next four ingredients are also terrible: ""chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour, beef tallow preserved with mixed-tocopherols"". Chicken by-product means not the actual meat of the chicken, but everything else (e.g. bones, skin, organs, feet, etc.); corn gluten meal is just more corn; wheat is the single most common allergen for dogs; beef tallow is rendered fat and tocopherols don't actually have vitamin E in them, but ""may have"" vitamin E sometimes.<br /><br />So while your dog will love this for the same reason that people love Big Macs, it doesn't make it good for them and you can find better food for them for a similar price. Just remember: no corn ever and meat should be the first ingredient."

141260,Lynnster,1,"UPDATED APRIL 2012: I'm returning 6 more pouches of PureBites Chicken today, after first calling the company for instructions. The same rep (female) who responded to my complaint in  Dec 2011 took my call today, but not knowing I had called before, she kept insisting there has never been a complaint about rancid bits before. I told her I called in Dec and she said ""someone else likely helped you"". Not wanting to argue, I moved on, but she clearly lied to me so I thought I should update about this. I was asked to include a note this time, to say where purchased but that has nothing to do with the fact that the company thinks it's ""acceptable"" that some fat is getting thru via processing. Fat cannot be freeze-dried so it will turn rancid even if freeze dried - read my original review and see how this was answered the 1st time I called last year...Very disappointing that the company doesn't care to hold the processing plant's feet to the fire about fat getting in, but then to lie to a customer is not good. But they will honor their satisfaction guarantee! So the only way to get this issue resolved is for all of us to get refunds. All you need to do is send the proof of purchase and your invoice to the address on the bag, along with your name & address. I find that about half of the bags are rancid. Dogs don't care, but cats won't eat rancid anything so very expensive if issue is ignored. Pls help make this company fix this issue by sending proofs in and forcing them to refund. Companies ignore issues until their wallets get hit. I hate to do this, but my cats beg for these and I'm going broke replacing rancid bags!<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: I bought two 6.2 oz bags of PureBites Chicken for dogs, first trying out a small cat size pouch found at PetSmart, and then moved up to the dog-sized bags/chunks, which I crumble with my fingers to get them smaller for my cats, who love this product BUT both of these bags purchased on Amazon had rancid chunks that smushed into slimy/greasy mush when I crumbled them.<br /><br />The company admits this happens, said it's part of the processing, nothing can be done, but it's not acceptable, and they will refund once I send proof of purchases & invoice to them.<br /><br />So it's hit or miss, and the company agrees...so just an FYI to warn others to check their bags!<br /><br />For those feeding this to dogs, and not breaking up the chunks like I do, please take note of this and check on the chunks before feeding. You can also detect a faint rancid odor if there are rancid bits in your bags.<br /><br />The reason for the rancid chunks, according to the company is that pieces of fatty chicken do get in, and fat doesn't freeze-dry, so without preservatives, it will go rancid. I knew that, but had hoped they could offer a promise to correct this; they can't and have no intention to do so. So I'll keep buying and hoping I get good bags, but will certainly take the time to get refunded whenever this occurs.<br /><br />The product is excellent when you get a good bag..just check each piece before feeding, or if you have a good nose for rancid odors, take a whiff and you'll smell the slight rancid odor, and can return the product."

The black licorice aftertaste was so powerful, it made it impossible to really taste anything else after the first sip.

What a waste of money and potable water."
213239,JJJlock,1,This burned the heck out of my scalp. I couldnt rinse this out fast enough and it was STILL burning after rinsing. What the heck is in here. It doesn't lather as well either it's wayyyy to thick. It's LOADED with fragrances its one of the first ingrediants as is SLS and silicones which are bad for your hair. I'd totally skip this one. Also this has Zinc Pyrithione which is for dandruff and I think this might have helped cause the burning if you have NO dandruff then use this it has nothing to burn through so to speak. Anyway I'd def. skip this.

Open the can and saw that the calories are from 35 grams of sugar (fruit juice) and nothing else, I thought to myself, this is all sugar melted in water and carbonated, I drank a sip and could already feel sticky in my mouth on the teeth. It's going to rot my teeth for sure and leave a sticky mouth feel. Carbonated just not like what I would call a good carbonation like soda or mountain dew. It's less carbonation than those but has as much sugar or more than a can of soda. This is just sugar water."
237535,Penny Duff,1,"Ritz Crackers USED TO be my favorite cracker. I loved the buttery flavor with just a little salt.  That all ended with the last box purchased.  The crackers were almost white--half baked, no flavor except heavy salting.  Gone was the golden color, the buttery flavor.  All that was left was white cracker and heavy salt.  I contacted Kraft/Nabisco.  They apparently thought I was complimenting them, and only sent back ads for more Nabisco products.  They were very flip and apparently didn't care that the quality of this product was utterly gone.  Use extreme caution in purchasing this product any more."

Then maybe a few specks of some type of powder, which I presume is some derivative of MSG.  Then it has one flake of oregano.  Then it has MSG.  Then it has one speck of parsley flakes.  Then it claims to have onion powder, but I think it's just more MSG.  Finally, it has MSG-powder, MSG-salt and MSG-flakes.  Perfect stuff for your next MSG-induced nightmare headache, the likes of which you've never known.  Other than that, you'll probably like this stuff.<br /><br />Edited to respond to the lone critic who claims this does NOT have MSG...an individual I can only surmise is a shareholder or employee of Goya...so, here's the ingredient list for you people, since he, while claiming it has no MSG (not true), failed to provide it himself:<br /><br />Ingredients: Salt, Granulated Garlic, Tricalcium Phosphate (prevents caking), Monosodium Glutamate, Oregano, Black Pepper, Tumeric, Onion Powder, Spices.<br /><br />Note that ""spices"" can also be termed to include MSG as well, but here they go the extra measure and at least spell it out for you...something this other reviewer must have missed or be unable to read.<br /><br />So, there you have it.

After receiving it, carefully cleaning, and reading the instructions word for word, we were disappointed to find out that it does not work. Going back on Amazon and the Baby Brezza site for help, We realized that there are many recent reviews with the same problem. These reviews were posted AFTER we had ordered the item.<br /><br />I'm personally upset because even if the customer service for this product may be as wonderful as they say, receiving a defective product in the mail and getting help on it is both a waste of mine and the company's time. I feel like the last 2 hours of my day has been wasted preparing the food, waiting for it to steam, trouble shooting the blender, reading up about fixes online, and lastly calling customer service to only get a voicemail. I hope that this goes better for other parents. Good luck.<br /><br />UPDATE: I emailed baby brezza on Nov 7th and called them Nov 4th.

While the gumballs taste good initially, the flavors wear off quickly, so I give this product one star for that and for the deception of the photo of the product which shows the container fills to the top when the actual product is filled partially above the label, and lastly for the heavily markup of the price which undoubtedly will increase soon.

The problem is not with the product, but with the shipping. The first time I ordered it for her, all six cans were so dented in the box that we were scared to open them. The one piece of packing material,a completely deflated ballon, did not keep the cans from rolling around in a box way to large for them.

There is hardly any curry or coconut flavors, and in fact it tastes more like pine sap than anything else.  I followed the stove top directions (cooking food in cardboard seems weird to me) and was slightly put off by the aromas.  They weren't horrible, but didn't smell like curry either.  At first bite, my heart sank.  I was expecting a rich, tongue-wrenchingly spicy red curry, and all I got was an artificially thickened, oddly pine needle tasting and not very spicy concoction.

Also the images make them look larger than they are.  They basically fit in the palm of your hand.<br /><br />If you are looking for something similar to a Kashi cookie I would try these.

187872,IsaacB,1,"My son is 9 weeks old and has been through 4 different formulas.  Come to find out he is lactose intolerant (or very very sensitive to it.)  I suspected he was sensitive to the lactose.  He had major gas and would scream every time he ate.  Two different ""gentle"" milk based formulas gave him diarrhea and two different soy formulas gave him a rash, horrible constipation and my pediatrician didn't like the soy (although I and plenty of other kids I know had soy formula and we're just fine) so I purchased Gentlease since it is supposed to be for gas and fussiness and my pediatrician gave us samples.  He was on it for a full month before I decided that no matter how much time I gave it, this formula was not helping.  If anything, it was worse.  I thought it was colic but looking back, I believe this formula was the cause of most of his discomfort and screaming fits.  I am a first time mom so I had no idea.  I only wish I had thought to switch sooner.  On this formula, my baby would scream while feeding, push the bottle away, come off the nipple MANY times, only take 1-2 ounces at a time and eat every 1/2-1 hour (the formula is very thin and he couldn't eat more than 2oz at a time) I thought he had reflux due to him eating such small meals so frequently and the way he was screaming and arching his back when he ate.  Wrong.  If you have this formula, TASTE IT!  It is extremely bitter and smells yucky.  No wonder he didn't eat!  Also, it has lactose in it still so it did not help with his gas.  Immediately when he started drinking, CRAZY GAS!  This continued hours after he had finished eating and then time for another feeding.  We switched to Baby's Own organic lactose free and WOW what a difference.  Yes, it is a few dollars more but SO worth it.  Yes, he stil has a little gas but I would say it is normal baby gas and definetly not painful.  He eats 3-4oz a feeding and sleeps 2-3 hour stretches.  He is playful and happy.  MUCH HAPPIER BABY AND MUCH HAPPIER PARENTS!  Also, the new formula smells and tastes like milk.  Yes, after that experience, I had to try it."

547896,E. Kinard,1,"Bush's Best Baked Beans 8/165 oz cans:  This order was a joke!  The carton holding the cans had been opened and was then retaped.  Every can in the case is dented, even the ones on the inside.  It seems that damaged cans were collected, put into an opened carton, re-taped, then sent on to me.  Shame on you Amazon shippers; you should not be working there.  What a gross inconvenience!  What a horrid thing for any customer to receive!"
441612,J.W.,1,I keep hearing about how wonderful is Annie's pasta so I tried this product. A big mistake. The sauce is extremely SALTY. I should not have purchase this product as now I have so many boxes remaining. I'll just keep the pasta and toss out the sauce packets. Stay away if you do not like your food over-salted.
438784,martinent,1,"This was suppose to be a 35 cup sampler pack. When it arrived(in a brown paper bag), I thought, OK this will be a good variety because I was happy to see that they were not spending a fortune on what I call useless packaging. But we were very disappointed when we opened it up. There were 35 K cups, but only 9 were not ""Green Moutain"" brand and of the 35, 18 were of 3 different flavors and a 4th flavor had 4 of it. That really does not give a very good sampling of flavors. Especially when 15 of the 35 are of a vanilla flavor(Vanilla creme, french vanilla, deluxe vanilla, etc.).<br /><br />I will have to think twice before we buy another sample pack, when it really does not give a very good sampling. No where even close to the picture that was provided. Keeping in mind that we did not expect exactly what was in the picture, but at least no more than 2-3 of any given flavor."

273470,Wild life welcome,1,"This is very cheaply created Umeboshi and no true taste. It has uncured runny meat, just full of salt. Obviously it was not sundry - typically at least for 7 days which will shrink the meat more compact and has to be cured for 6 month or more with each shiso-wrapped in ceramic barrel. That's the way it's done in true Japanese Umeboshi which bring out great Sour flavor in the first bite as well as true health benefit of Umeboshi and will not have the taste of salt.<br />My family or many of people who really know how to make Umeboshi in Japan, will cure Umeboshi for at least one year and some are up to seven years. You only eat the one from the prior year harvest not from the same year harvest.<br />Most of health benefit of Umeboshi can only be true in well cured Umeboshi of 6 month minimum, otherwise you get the symptom of uneasy, queasy stomach taste. Normally children are advised not to have more than one Umeboshi for this reason.<br />Hope Eden people rework on how to make Umeboshi properly."

Hydrogenated or non-hydrogenated coco oil?  The latter better than the former....both not so good, anyway.<br />If you pop corn once in a while with Paragon + flavacol, you will not go wrong.  I wouldn't consume this combo very often, like maybe once or twice a month?.......by the same token, just like eating fat laden prime rib, potato chips, hotdogs, all the good stuff, is bad for your cholesterol lol.<br />Sadly all the snacks and fast foods we enjoy.....sucks.<br />C'est la vie."

I trust Nong Shim to in the very least deliver a quality product.<br /><br />These quite honestly were the blandest non spicy packaged noodles I've ever tasted, and I even used less water to make the broth stronger. FAIL The noodles were the same as Shin Ramen. There were three little packets in the package. I'm guessing dried veggies or seaweed, a light oil and the broth base, looked like beef? (dark brown color)<br />This tasted like mushrooms to me. No spicy flavor whatsoever.<br />Not exactly sure what Chajang Noodles are supposed to really taste like, but I'm not a fan. This is what happens when you try to mix two different cuisines (Italian-Spaghetti) and Asian (Chajang) Epic FAIL!!<br />I'll stick with the good old Shin Ramen. Same price and way better taste in my opinion.<br />Avoid Avoid Avoid unless you just prefer boring bland flavor in your noodles!"

118041,ceastama,1,"As I am writing this, this listing has 130 (out of 173) 1-star reviews (soon to be 131). Please bear in mind that I rarely review products; I must feel very strongly about one before I review it.<br /><br />I am an adventurous person, and when it comes to food, as long is it is vegetarian I will try anything. Even if the experience is terrible I do not regret chancing it; this is how you find GOOD foods (also bad). But IMHO this product is not good and it is probably not food. Judging by the ingredients, it appears to be mainly water, vegetable fiber (probably the bulk of its volume), and peanut flavoring/extract. I lean toward health foods and like others, have portion control issues when it comes to legit pb, one of my famous weaknesses. I was intrigued when I found this in our local wal mart; calorie-free imitation peanut butter! With low expectations I opted to give it a fair chance BEFORE reading a single review.<br /><br />I mistakenly applied this product single-agent to a sandwich. I have not yet managed to consume this in its entirety; it was a failed experiment. I will hold off on throwing this out until I have mustered up the courage to attempt it in a different setting. It has a few positive reviews, so I suspect that it may be redeemable somehow (I may take up some reviewers' suggestions) but thus far I believe this product to be a travesty; this is coming from a person who can tolerate certain well-known brands of veggie bacon.<br /><br />Okay, I knew this product would be so different from actual pb that it would be unfair to compare it. I did not expect it to resemble pb, however I did expect it to resemble food at least in some remote fashion. The texture is that of a synthetic, waxy, fluffy butter (why is it ""whipped""???). The taste is.. somewhat akin to the same, but I would not recommend it as a butter substitute except in non-food usages which I may attempt, as I hate to be wasteful. I would compare the taste to what I would expect of a spread made from crayons. Brown crayons, ew.<br /><br />So here's my 100% honest and dead-serious evaluation: truly, you and I are better off looking to natural sources with awesome flavor and more balanced nutrition to go with the calories. We could probably do with a little less artifice all around, and this product has no nutritional value whatsoever-- except some sodium. It even lacks dietary fiber, despite vegetable fiber being the second ingredient listed (after water)! If you are trying to eat healthier, this is surely not the way. If you are on a low-calorie diet, learn portion control-- and I empathize with the pain you feel in even considering cutting down on our beloved peanut butter. As for myself, I have to get my protein from somewhere and pb is my main squeeze, so in my pantry the Walden Farms was never destined to be more than a novelty to begin with.<br /><br />The one good thing that came of this experience, besides satisfying my curiosity? A number of the 1-star reviews praised certain other Walden Farms products DESPITE this unforgettable failure. I consider this a brave endorsement as I would personally be embarrassed to defend the entities that brought this abomination into our world. So brave, in fact, that I am convinced of their authenticity (unless ALL of these individuals are trolling), and will be looking forward to sampling OTHER Walden Farms products (this was my first). But, as for redeeming this one, I am not hopeful.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />- I DO NOT recommend this product in any way.<br /><br />- I CANNOT recommend any alternative low-cal pb substitutes as I have not personally sampled any others.<br /><br />+ I DO recommend MaraNatha for a more natural and flavorful nut butter experience. With some self-control it is worth the calories and the price.<br /><br />+ I HIGHLY recommend, in addition to the above, diet and exercise. If you can't cut portions, walk it off."

I subscribe and save to these because honestly i eat 12 boxes in about a week and a half.  However, quaker changed the number of bars in a pack from 10 to now only 8!  Same price yet 2 fewer bars per pack. Now with this order I'm basically getting 2 less boxes each time for the same price.  Amazon should have at least warned me that my 10-count 12 pack order was now an 8-count 12 pack order and that i would be paying the same price.<br /><br />I guess its back to buying the variety pack at costco with 60 bars, the downside being the dreadful oatmeal raisin bars I am inevitably forced to eat.

However, when you pour your red wine through the aerator, the wine leaks out through the two air holes and fills the base of the stand with red wine.  The wine even splashed out through the holes too.  Following the exact instructions of carefully pouring the wine into the aerator so that is runs down the side of the aerator only, was better except for the fact that the red wine then only leaked out of one air hole instead of two.<br /><br />I give the Vinturi Aerator Set one star for beauty only.  Now, where do I send the dry cleaning bill to?"

First Amazon does not ship dry packaged goods well. This is one of several boxes of food that has arrived at my house either crushed or in crumbs. After getting beyond the look, the flavor left a bitter after taste. I enjoy vanilla, but I suspect that the extract in the cereal created this effect. The cereal itself includes flakes, rice crisps and puffs-too much going on for one cereal. The manufacturer needs to stick with one look and perfect that.<br /><br />All in all I would not recommend this cereal. There are better ones out there and for less money too."

432623,CoffeeMD,1,"I am sorry to say that I am more than disappointed with this tea. For many years I drank only genuine sencha (and gyokuro) tea shipped directly from Japan and I think I developed quite a good taste for premium Japanese Sencha. But since the Fukashima diaster I am distrustful of the radioactive contamination that has occurred  over all or wide areas of the Japanese  tea growing areas and I certainly do not trust the Japanese governments reports. So I no longer order my delicious premium sencha (no, REALLY premium, not the foil wrapped hyped premiums which are not premium at all, sold in stores). This is a great heartache for me, and of course for the Japanese people and tea growing industry.<br /><br />So I have been looking for a replacement, from another part of the world, thus bringing me to this Dilmah Sencha green tea. Now this is really bad. I see the reviews describing it as the best tea they've ever drunk and so on. Even allowing for differences in taste and taste bud sensitivities, I really think this is crazy. This tea has no taste. It bears no resemblance to Japense sencha. It happens to come from the same plant species apparently but the final product is completely unrelated, tasteless, no aroma, just, I'm sorry, totally worthless. Something is wrong here with these reports. And the brochure describing its many wonders and special cultivation, its just glossy hype.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I opened all the tea packaging so i could put the tea in one place so I am sure I cant return it or I would, for a full refund. I am really sorry to say this because I am desperate for good sencha green tea. This isnt it and will never be."

We needed to rush him to the emergency room where they induced vomiting and then monitored closely for 2 days at home until he threw it up on his own .... After surfing the internet we found numerous other claims with people having the same issue- some even needing to spend a few thousand on procedures to remove the ball.

I opened it and found most of the little creamer containers to be crushed to some degree, with the creamer leaked out all over the inside of the box. It had apparently been in this condition for a while as some of the creamer had thickened and adheared to the insides of the box in nasty clumps. At first, I thought perhaps I could check and save some of the little containers, but on second look, it was apparent I was wrong. What a nasty mess, and the worst part is even if I wanted to return this mess, I discovered it cannot be returned. So I'm appealing to you to consider refunding this horendous example of bad packaging. Until now, I've always been happy with Amazon and will probably order many other things down the road despite this incident, but I just think I shouldn't have to pay for such a mess. Thank you, Susan"

For some reason, the glue that holds down the tin foil on the top of the pod does not stay glued during the brewing process and coffee grounds come spilling out into the Keurig and the coffee below every time. We ordered another box thinking it was just a bad batch and they also do the same thing. Its a bummer that these k-cups can't be made better. The one cup of iced coffee that we dd get turned out to be very good!<br /><br />We won't be using these in our Keurig anymore. It is a huge pain to clean up the mess it makes every time we try to brew one.

Knowing that, when you compare it to other instant coffee products that are available this stuff is at or near the bottom of the flavor quality you expect from instant. So... that means it is cheaper to get yourself a cup of hot water from you coffee brewer, then add your favorite instant coffee.  There are two additional benefits of using your own favorite instant coffee - your cup of Joe will taste better and you will not have to clean your coffee brewer as this stuff leaves a residue in the brewer."

182301,Arnaud H,1,"First, make sure you read the ingredients listed on this product: Maltitol syrup, natural and artificial flavor, Acesulfame K, Malic acid. Acesulfame K is an artificial sweetener, like aspartame. It is still a very controversial substance, and although the FDA has approved it, more research has been recommended. Maltitol is produced from starch, and can cause gastrointestinal problems and diarrhea. This product is one of the most artificial sweetening agents that are on the market. It is highly processed using patented and confidential methods. The mention of ""honey"" on its label is disingenuous and actually in violation of several state laws. Raw, natural honey remains the best and healthier sweetener out there for people with type II diabetes as long as they use it in moderation."

My husband asked ""Where's the beef""?  There was literally zero beef flavor in the gravy. Ok, so what about onion soup mix?

After several vet trips and medications (benadryl, steriod, antifungal) did not work, we switched to A Taste of the Wild dog food.  13 days later, the dogs are no longer itching.

I got it when it was a brand new product line by them (new enough to get $1 off coupons, the REAL reason I tried them since they were barely over a dollar after the discount).<br /><br />The smell I agree with the 1-star review is really off putting... and it matches the taste PERFECTLY.<br /><br />What the taste IS? BABY FOOD. JUST LIKE BABY FOOD.<br /><br />When I got the lentil one with the coupon, I only got one... then went back and got the rest, along with a few of these (I haven't braved the mushroom yet). I wish I'd only gotten one. A dollar and change or not, NO WAY am I keeping them. I wouldn't even donate them. I added ground pepper... nope, baby food plus pepper. Sea salt made a bite of it almost edible--yknow, thick salty broth--and adding a touch of herbs just ruined the herbs.<br /><br />The reason it can't be salvaged? Their chicken is repulsive. I'm almost sure they boiled the bird, and that is only acceptable for broth where the bird gets removed. In fact, I have a hunch--especially given the whole thing possessed ONE tiny flaky pea sized square of meat--they got ""responsible"" and took the bird etc used for the broth--the broth strained out and packaged--and just blended that boiled limp weird-odor meat and such and tossed in some rice flour and dairy to try passing it for soup.<br /><br />Ever made your own broth, the kind where you boil it til the bird is almost Michael Jackson white because you aren't going to use it as part of the dish and want to yank all its flavor out? You know how funky boiled, denatured bird smells and tastes? This is that bird. Now I have finally figured out why baby food is so repulsive, a mystery I was content to never even ponder. I hate that I am dumping the remaining 90% of this out, but I'll be tasting it coming back up if I don't (4 tiny spoonfuls and it already has me belchy and nauseous!).

Back in late October 2011 I switched to Blue Buffalo after it was recommended by a family member. By mid-November Calla started to cry out at night. We thought it might be a back issue and our ""Three"" yes three Vets agreed that it could be Intervertebral Disc Disease. We had blood work done in November and everything looked fine with the exceptions that she was a ""little"" dehydrated. After months of treatments, with little to no improvement we thought it might be a stomach issue and I started to think about the timing of the change to Blue Buffalo, then I went and goggled ""Consumer complaints about Blue Buffalo Pet Foods"" and started to really connect the dots. Yesterday she was diagnosed with ""Pancreatitis"" and needs to be in the hospital for days for treatment. I have spent over 3K to this point and do not know if Calla will ever recover fully from this.

And that someone could have been me! Well to make a point, it was stale. And since we opened a bag it could not be returned so now we have 4 bags of stale coffee. Do yourself a favor a pass this one by. Seriously. Thing is I am disabled. I am not crying about that, but that means a limited income. Amazon helps me to order in any items I can. Recently I have had to depend on a cane because the pain is too great. The problem in a nutshell is I think there is not enough ""stock rotation"" in the warehouse. I had the same problem with the Duracell batteries. Half the package was dead. Now all the other thing are fine. I love amazon. I have sold on Amazon for years. Good customers good people. (Personally, I tried the coffee and it was not the best but I have tasted worse.) That's all. Thank you."

If it is miso I'm usually happy with it. The first thing I noticed were the onions, they were brown and pathetic looking, like they had been used after they were rotten. The smell of this soup is like nothing I have experienced before it is so off putting I didn't want to try it at first, but I was famished, and only had a 15 minute break in between meetings.

38506,"MicTrik ""mictrik""",1,"Well, once again a great product has been cheapened in the name of ""American taste"".  I find it hard to believe that anyone would prefer this ""new"" recipe that Lindt is using for its Chocolate sold in the USA.  I should of known something was up because I noticed that the Lindt bars were on sale for far too long at the supermarket.  That is often a sign of a product being cheapened some time after an acquisition from a conglomerate or private equity company; Kettle chips come to mind.<br /><br />Those who were previously in charge of marketing and merchandising Lindt bars in the USA had to know that their market was a little more upscale and refined than those who consume a Hershey or a Reeses.  I bet some new (American) management got involved.  That ""market taste test"" someone referred to is mostly BS; they already knew that Americans in general have unsophisticated child like tastes, that pander to the overly sweet, artificial and creamy.  Sweet artificial and creamy pretty much sums up American food with the exception of meats.  However in the case of meats sweet artificial sauces and fake smoke flavor abound for ""dipping""; Americans love their finger dipping food!  Coming off the diatribe, it is clear that Lindt is now more interested in competing with Hershey for the taste of the ""average joe"".  After all it costs less to produce chocolate for their taste.  So the gamble is this; will they profit more by making a cheaper bar and competing against Hershey for the taste of Joe average or by keeping their quality high and catering to those who know better?  American management is notorious for pursuing the ""quick money"", and I know this is a pretty audacious assumption but i bet that Lindt hired on a few Americans to run local manufacturing / Marketing and this change is being conducted at their behest.  Short term, these American managers look good (the quick win) because they lowered their cost basis by decreasing production cost.  Long term, American management mostly moved on and Lindt is now a cheapened brand that just barely survives (in the USA) competing with the likes of Hershey.  We shall see, but I will not buy another Lindt product while Stateside.<br /><br />Can anyone advise of an alternative European dark chocolate bar (70-90%) that is reasonably priced and available in the States.

I'm thinking the combination of Guarana, Yerba Mate, Rooibos, Ginko Biloba, Taurine & the other added ""antioxidants + ADAPTOGENS"" (what ever that is!)may not be a good combination for consumption.

When this product arrived I learned that it was a product of the USA, Brazil, and Vietnam.  There are two problems with that.<br /><br />The first is that US honey producers are struggling to survive, and cannot hope to compete with the price of honey produced in the third world.  Why do we care?  Because they are vital to our survival, and our ability to produce food.  We need to make a concerted effort to patronize US honey.<br /><br />The second concern is that many pesticides banned here in the US are still used in places like Vietnam and Brazil.  (And the ones still in use here are bad enough!) Because of the nature of bees and the production of honey, it seems inevitable that some contamination is likely to occur.  For that reason, I am not terribly thrilled with the idea of consuming honey originating anywhere other than the US, Canada, or Europe.<br /><br />Other than the above concerns, the honey is well packaged, and visually attractive.  But I am now looking for a source of honey packets containing only honey sourced in the US."

198285,P. Fant,1,"The little ""tree"" certainly looked healthy; yet the ""trunk"" was really weird - a bulbous ""v"" shape coming up to a top that had no branches, just a puff of stems with leaves.  Had it not had a confined root system in a small pot with a wire it had grown around, I would have sworn someone had just chopped off a bush, let it sprout back and then dug up the plant and called it a bonsai.  I took it to work to make sure it wasn't just me.  Everyone agreed it was weird and ugly."
207665,"*Auntie Lynn* ""color & pigment specialist; wa...",1,"Maybe I should have said ""this is not 100% white tea."" But then, so should Lipton have said just that. Even though it does not say so in the tea name, the sub-title name, or any of the information anywhere on the box EXCEPT the ingredients list in very very small type (had to get my reading glasses!) -- the second ingredient in this ""white"" tea is green tea.<br /><br />Why? Because white tea is very expensive. It is costly because it is hard, labor intensive work to harvest white tea. If they sold this product made completely out of white tea -- they would not make as much money.<br /><br />But then, they also would not be deceiving their customers. I drink white tea and rooibos red teas because they are naturally either caffeine free, or so low in caffeine that it doesn't give me the migraines which caffeine cause for me.<br /><br />Lipton's deception did cause a migraine. And they have permanently lost a customer because of their intentional deceit.<br /><br />All of the other major tea companies make sure their products are clearly labeled as ""caffeine free,"" ""contains caffeine,"" ""naturally low in caffeine,"" ""those sensitive to caffeine please read ingredients....""  But not Lipton.  They made these pretty little pyramid tea bags, but put the same old sad corporate ethics inside."
418145,kare and compassion,1,"I would have to agree wholeheartedly with the other one star reviews. This tiny little packet was way over priced and the vendor charged way too much for shipping. They charged $5.98 for shipping an item that they probably could have sent with a single first class postage stamp affixed.<br /><br />I agree with those individuals who said these tablets taste funny and are definitely not sweet.  After dissolving the tablet, the quarter slice of lemon that I bit into was only slightly sweet... MY son said it tasted like lemonade. It did sort of taste like lemonade - more sour than sweet.  After that the effect pretty much was unnoticeable. I tried it again tonight with some raspberries and sour cherries. I tasted no difference, other than that of the strange lingering after-taste that the tablet leaves behind.<br /><br />Another person mentioned having tasted tea after dissolving a tablet on the tongue. Like that person, I did notice a difference but did not really care for the taste. More like an artificial sweetener than like sugar. My son and I were very disappointed with this purchase.<br /><br />[...]"

Was making curried butternut squash bisque for the first time.  The bisque was good, but little did I know, it could have been much better.<br /><br />Because this product was so expensive -- it took a whole jar to give my bisque a mild curry flavor -- I looked to Amazon for an alternative.  Found <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EI2LLO"">Mae Ploy Thai Red Curry Paste - 14 ounce per jar</a> and gave it a try.  Prepared the same butternut squash bisque and Oh. My. Goodness!  What a difference!!<br /><br />Try the Mae Ploy ... you will get a HUGE container for a fraction of the cost, and the taste will be better than you ever knew was possible.  Kept in the fridge, it keeps for a good long while.  But, when you taste the wonderful flavor, you'll be looking for recipes calling for curry paste.  Try the yellow and the green curry too.  Totally different tastes."

70133,Trevor Burnham,1,"There's a stark disconnect between the front of the product's packaging (which promises ""Iced Green Tea"" with honey and natural fruit flavors) and the actual product. Lipton could conceivably have marketed convenient packets of gunpowder green tea, with its characteristic bitterness subtly curbed by tiny amounts of honey and fruit oils. Such a product might have been a hit with the health-obsessed, ingredient-conscious crowd that already enjoys unsweetened tea. Instead, they decided to go for a more mainstream audience: people who crave sweet-as-soda beverages, but want to feel good about what they're drinking.<br /><br />The result is a product that's almost indistinguishable from <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5DHE"">Sugar Free Kool-Aid</a>, but will likely be brought to market at a much higher price point based on its supposed healthfulness. The Lipton Stix packaging brags that (unlike Kool-Aid) it's got ""no aspartame""--because it uses the artificial sweetener sucralose (aka Splenda) instead. Yes, green tea powder is the third ingredient (after honey granules and citric acid)--but to give you an idea of how much tea there is in this ""tea mix,"" a chart on the side brags about Lipton Stix containing 60mg of flavonoids per serving, comparing favorably to cranberry juice and orange juice. This is an extremely selective comparison. Most pertinently, a cup of tea typically contains anywhere from 200mg to 1000mg of flavonoids, depending on the variety, density, and brewing process.<br /><br />Now, it's one thing to emphasize a product's naturalness (""natural flavors,"" ""made with real ingredients,"" ""tea & honey,"" ""real fruit flavors"") without mentioning the artificial sweetener anywhere other than the ingredient list. But there's one claim that I believe to be overtly deceptive: ""sweetened with honey."" Let's examine that. Honey is listed in the ingredients as ""Honey granules (sugar, honey),"" which means that there's actually at least as much sugar as honey in the product. A half-packet serving has ~1g of sugars, so even under the generous assumption that there's as much honey as pure sugar, there's only about half a gram of honey per serving. Is it conceivable that you could detect half a gram of honey in 8oz of water? Certainly not if you add enough sucralose to make that 8oz of water taste as sweet as fruit juice (~25g of sugars).<br /><br />So to summarize: At best, honey accounts for 1/50th of the sweetness in Lipton Stix that the sucralose provides. Shame on you, Lipton."

524999,R.Thibodeaux,1,"Unfortunately, zero stars not possible on here. I agree with the reviewer who said ""yuck"" (though I wouldn't put it as straightforwardly rude as that). When I saw these Mrs. Fields White Chunk Macadamia cookies on here and saw some people thought they were good I just HAD to say something (and, check my record- I usually don't post reviews!)!  I bought 2boxes of these Mrs. Fields White Chunk Macadamia because I love Mrs. Fields- I adore her other cookies/wanted so much to love these!  However, the first bite of this White Chunk Macadamia cookie ruined that. The 1st box I bought from a local CVS store. They are totally bland and have virtually no flavor- even the white chocolate didn't have any flavor although the chunks were plentiful. Which is kinda unbelievable- as, white chocolate is supposed to make it even more flavorful (for example- Hershey's white chocolate bars and kisses taste, extremely flavorful/like chocolate). VERY DISAPPOINTED in this flavor of Mrs. Fields.  Since I love Mrs Fields Cookies (and, obviously, giving her the benefit of the doubt):  I thought, ok, maybe I got a bad box.  So, I bought another one from the Walgreens in Downtown Chicago. AND NOPE- THIS FLAVOR IS STANDARDLY BLAND AND TASTELESS.  The only good thing about these cookies were that both boxes were very fresh/cookies were indivially wrapped as advertised.  If only Mrs. Fields would've put as much thought into the actual cookie itself!! SO- IF YOU HAVE A TASTE FOR WHITE CHOCOLATE AND BUY THIS COOKIE PLEASE BE PREPARED TO HAVE 2THINGS ON HAND- BOTH WHICH ACTUALLY TASTES LIKE  WHITE CHOCOLATE, AND A REAL CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE!  HOW could a professional like Mrs. Fields get this so horribly wrong????  When it comes to sweets I'm easy to please- trust me (and, my scale can, at times, attest to that):  But, in this case THIS COOKIE NEEDS A REDO!!  I am convinced that the people who thought these even had a scintilla of taste either works for the company, or need tastebud transplants! I've been as honest as I can.  I wonder what Gordon Ramsay would say to Mrs. Fields upon sampling these white chunk Macadamia cookies???  Oh, the horror."
461619,All Rater,1,It has hidden MSG (a known neurotoxin). Terrible tasting and I love Triscuit. It tastes like old stale garlic powder and smelly feet.

522321,"Catherine M. Luxton ""CL""",1,"We used Dasuquin with MSM with our almost 15 year old Shih Tzu per vet recommendations. After about a week diarrhea began and increased in frequency as time went on. It took a little while to recognize the cause as we had started other medications almost simultaneously but a web search, stopping each medication separately and waiting for the effect proved Dasuquin chews to be the cause.<br />It caused diarrhea about 4-5 hours after administration and extremely foul smelling stools. Numerous inquiries on the web can be found about this. We were not warned by the vet nor does the literature available that we received say anything about it. As it is a supplement versus a regulated medication, there is a typical lack of indications of adverse conditions.<br />As for its effectiveness otherwise, I cannot comment. The dog liked the taste and ate the chews readily but the consequences were terrible!"

To be fair, the resultant soup tastes good, but, with these ingredients, it should; I just wish I had known what would be called for prior to spending any money.

Often sauces which please in the restaurant, suffer in mass production and end up a pale sister of the original. I believe this is what happened here. The color and consistency of the sauce set up expectations which are not met by the taste test. There are several, commonly available 'off the shelf' sauces that mimic this Tomato Basil. I wish I could be positive about the experience but this sauce left me wanting more. Of course, the low price suggests low expectations but once shipping is added - I have almost $12.00 invested in this less than gratifying experience."

741,Scott Schrantz,1,"I can honestly say this is the worst frosting we have ever bought. It's kind of generous to call it frosting, it has more the consistency of rubber cement. And since we were in a time crunch, we didn't have the luxury of going back out to the store for a different frosting, so we forged ahead and decorated a cake with it. Horrible experience, bad enough to put us off cake decorating forever. It spread about as easily as chewing gum, stuck to everything it came in contact with, and got crumbs of the cake mixed up in it. On top of all this, it didn't even taste good. By the time we were done decorating, we knew there was no way we could feed this mess to our family. So we ended up going to the store anyway to buy a pre-made cake. Our cake, which took twice as long to decorate because this stuff is so gooey, was used as a centerpiece. A really ugly centerpiece, that cracked and peeled as the frosting dried."

It was supposed to arrive in ten business days, but never came at all, not while she was still working, or even after she got worse and was home bound waiting.  I know this is true, because I didn't know her home address, so I told them to deliver it to the school....so I know it never came.  I have e-mailed the company several times, and they have never replied, although they still spam me with info on new items...as if I would ever order from them again.  Buyer beware - the company I bought mine from was a total rip-off!"

296906,C. Mckenzie,1,"Our 2-year-old daughter is allergy sensitive to many foods and had horrible, blister rashes after consuming these on a regular basis. They use an extract from the chia seed (salvia hispanica) as an herbal fatty acid. This extract causes diarrhea, hives, skin rashes and the mouth, tongue and throat to swell. Our daughter had all these symptoms and her pediatrician thought she had scarlet fever until the antibiotic he prescribed had no effect on her horrible poin-ivy-like rash that itched like crazy."
160826,L. Johnson,1,"Same complaint I made elsewhere.  This product is so horribly salty I can't taste the seasoning.  I won't buy it again.  Now, I won't throw it away, though.  I'll use it as salt.  That's all it is.  It's just salt, and when I put on the appropriate amount of salt, I won't expect to taste any seasoning (despite the claim on the package that when it's salty enough, it's seasoned to perfection).  My partner says he used to use Tony's many years ago, and that something has changed.  Says it wasn't so dreadfully salty back then."

I have been disregarded by CS reps on multiple occasions and told that amazon would not have them back in stock (even though they had them minutes before for a much higher price). It would seem that instead of standing behind their sales, they find it easier to cancel the orders of their customers and tell them to re-order for a much higher price after already waiting 3 weeks for the product that was purchased. Seriously disappointed in amazon, this is the third purchase in a row that has been cancelled due to them not wanting to/not able to fulfill the orders."

316286,Meredith Harper Pickens,1,"I absolutely ADORE the Original Flavor of Zola Acai Drinks and I've had a standing subscription order for a couple of years - for both the smaller, 12 oz bottles and the larger 32 oz size.  But the last three months of the 32 oz size have been UNDRINKABLE!  I don't know if anyone else has experienced this problem, but I am so disappointed because it's always been top-quality before these last 3 shipments.<br /><br />Each of the 8 32-oz size bottles have had thick green stuff floating around in it...it's almost a neon green color, and it is a consistency kind of like algae. Weirdly enough, the 12-oz bottles in my order have been fine. The first time my order was like that, I shrugged it off and thought that maybe I had let 1-2 bottles sit outside in my car in the Florida summer heat, but every single bottle had green junk floating all through it, and I know that I did not even take 6-7 bottles in my car or any other place where it could have gotten contaminated.<br /><br />The second month/order it happened, I saved the receipt, took photos of the green stuff, and tried to contact the seller and Amazon. Unfortunately they do not accept returns! At the time I was so busy I forgot to cancel my standing order of the 32 oz bottles and so they shipped a third month of the 32-oz bottles and they too had the same problem. Each month I have also received my standing order of 2 boxes of 12-oz drinks and they have been FINE - no green gunk. But I've been stuck having to pour out each of the 32-oz bottles, and at a cost of close to $50 each time, that has been a HUGE waste of $$ for me.<br /><br />I don't know whether the problem has been only with bottles shipped from my seller (?) or if it is affecting everyone's orders. I have noticed that some other distributors online do accept returns, but I am not willing to risk going through this again with someone different. Maybe some purchasers actually drink the tall bottles with the green gunk, and maybe it wouldn't harm me or my kids, but it makes me queasy to see that in a glass when I pour a drink...and it tastes a little funky - so down the drain they go. In the 2-3 years I've been buying Zola drinks, I've never had this problem, so maybe it's temporary or maybe there's a logical explanation that I'm just not aware of. Good luck if you try the tall bottles."
135086,"Howard Hinman ""hhinman""",1,"We ordered this Jamon through Amazon (thank goodness!). The merchant missed the promised shipping date and the Jamon arrived late. Upon opening the box, we first noticed a large tag around the product that stated ""Keep Refrigerated"". The item was shipped unrefrigerated in a simple cardboard box. Upon opening the product package, it was covered in a yellowish slime with white mold spots on it.<br /><br />We contacted the merchant who refused a replacement or a refund stating simply ""We do not offer refunds on grocery items"" - and they closed our request. Fortunately Amazon's ""A to Z"" guarantee saved the day for us and Amazon is refunding. We will not do business with this vendor again. We will instead pay the slightly higher price at La Tienda as we had previously. So much for trying to save a few dollars using another vendor."

The Galeos label claims 14 calories and 1 gram of fat per tablespoon serving. That's where the problems start.

Since the Sophia's dressing had those ingredients I was hopeful it would taste somthing like it. I was wrong. My husband had it on one salad and refused to eat it again. I never got around to using it. Whenever I had a Greek or Mexican salad, there was always another dressing I'd rather have. When I recently cleaned the refrigerator and pantry trying to get rid of things I don't use for more space, I tasted the dressing. The flavors don't seem to go with Greek food at all. I thought it was horrible and immediately threw out the open bottle and the 5 still remaining in the pantry. I'm sorry I had to purchase 6 of these. It was an expensive mistake."

I subscribed via Amazon a few years ago, and for whatever reason the last 3 boxes have arrived damaged.  They have a awelfull tainted taste unlike ones that are found in local stores.  They had a yellowish color (normally off white), and looked like they had been melted several times over even though the expiration date was current.  The last box, Amazon said they would fix the issue but havent.  I cannot return them because of Amazons policy.  Also interesting, I wrote a review similar to this one regarding the same issue, but Amazon deleted it off the website.  In any event, I cancelled my subcription and will contact the makers of this good product to let them know that somewhwere in the shipment process it is being mishandeling.

259551,SuzyQ,1,"My review of Traverse Bay Fruit Co's dried cherries is going to be almost identical to Robert J. Kiep's, which was written on 7/17/12.<br /><br />The cherries I ordered last year were plump, sweet, and delicious.  They came out of the package looking and tasting *perfect*, and remained perfectly wonderful to the very last one.  Last week I placed a new order for the cherries and what I got was something that might as well have been little bits of dried cardboard.  So I thought, ""Hmm, maybe I got a bad batch, let's call for a replacement.""  Amazon, as always, was great about sending a replacement right away.  But guess what?  I got the same tasteless, nearly colorless dried bits of cardboard again, which leads me to believe that Traverse Bay is doing something vastly different with their cherries now - or obtaining them from an altogether different source.<br /><br />Don't even consider purchasing these for the asking price.  It would be highway robbery.  I wouldn't spend $5 on the two boxes I received in the mail this week.  I think I will try Costco's dried cherries as I've read good things about them.  Bummer about Traverse Bay.  I'm disappointed.  I love to bake with dried cherries, and to snack on them, too.  On a positive note, the Amazon rep was kind enough to immediately refund my money, and to let me know that he'd look into the matter so that others here are not disappointed in a similar fashion."

My parents have an upgraded version, but I'm perfectly content with this mid-range unit.<br /><br />One thing to note, if you look at the picture of the box, there's a coupon there for a free box of coffee, which you cannot use - it's to be used only in conjunction with a physical purchase of the unit, which is kind of a bummer, to be honest.  But to be fair, it's not listed as part of the description, only something you'd notice if, like me, you looked at the picture of the box very closely before your purchase.<br /><br />I'm hoping it holds up well, because all of a sudden I am drinking A LOT more coffee!<br /><br />UPDATE: GRRR! So. Many. Problems.  First problem was all of a sudden it started making super weak coffee - Xtra bold, french roast, whatever, it was weak.  A little googling suggested that maybe the seal wasn't tight at the top needle. A bit of fiddling with the silicon doughnut seal seemed to fix that. I was back in love.  (FWIW, Keurig's customer service just sent me a free box of coffee as their ""fix."") Now in the last week it's begun the dreaded ""half cup"" syndrome.  I've only had it about a month and had already descaled (attempting to fix the weak coffee problem from before), but descaled again and cleaned the needles, and that seems to help, for about four cups. Then the damn thing brews half cups again. Grrrrr.  I suspect it'll be on its way back to Keurig this week - thank goodness I remembered to register & kept the box.<br /><br />I'm sorry folks, but for the price of these things I expect better. Much better - like a unit that works. Imagine how picky I am."

321832,sokowa,1,"I purchased this soda from my local health food store, thinking that because it came from a health food store and claimed to be 'natural', that it didn't use GMO ingredients (yes, I know, I was naive, lol) . After reading some of the comments here, especially the one about the ingredients not being as advertised by the company, I decided to do some research. I ended up emailing the company and asking them why they used erythritol and where their erythritol source came from. The response that I received appears below. I don't appreciate marketing that is designed to mislead consumers by throwing the word 'natural' around like this product does. I have enough labels to sift through to try to remove GMO from my diet. Figured I'd pass the info on.<br /><br />Hi Joanna,<br /><br />Erythritol is 100% natural. It occurs naturally in grapes, melons, pears, corn to name a few sources. It is made through a fermentation process like yeast. Erythritol has no calories and no effect on blood sugar levels. The reason we blend stevia (hundreds of time sweeter than sugar) with erythritol (only 70% the sweetness of sugar) is because the combination yields a natural sweetness that tastes like sugar. Using either sweetener alone would not please the palate like Zevia does.<br />------------------<br />Hi Joanna,<br /><br />Zevia is always considering ingredients that are safe for personal safety and health and that of our environments. Our erythritol is not certified Organic by the USDA and is not certified GMO-Free and is made from corn.  Zevia does seek out suppliers of GMO-free ingredients when they are available in the market and when it is a viable alternative, but we cannot make the claim that all of our ingredients are GMO-free. We promise that we will continue to explore ingredient alternatives when available and will always choose to do right by our customer and the environment."

The bottom of the cup is covered with it and you get to drink the dust as well.<br /><br />Even then, it is possible to get a decent tea from dustings (from The Book of Tea) but not with this stuff. It makes a weak, thin tea, no mater how long you steep it.<br /><br />There was not a single tea leaf in the first package I opened and spread out to look at after I got over the shock of having a bag of dust, just a couple small pieces and a lot of dustings.<br /><br />Hence, I really wonder about the other reviews, meaning what I got is NOT what they got, but it is what Amazon shipped to me. This stuff is junk.<br /><br />By the way, I have 12 different loose teas in the house at any time, with Keemun generally my favorite and Kenilworth my favorite Ceylon.

214828,CMBDOC,1,"I have been a doctor for 50 years. In that time there are now probably 1000 times as many medications and 500 times more medical procedures. Every one of them in order to be accepted has to undergo what is called a double blinded, placebo controlled study. An appropriate number of patients have to be recruited. In the case of Lipitor it was 10,000. 5000 took Lipitor and 5000 took the placebo, which looked exactly like the Lipitor pill. None of the patients or nurses or doctors knew who got what. All of the patients were seen often and after 5 years Pfizer broke the code and discovered that the Lipitor treated group had 50% less heart attacks, strokes and death. Every pill and every procedure has to be tested this way if it is to get on the market. FRS has never been tested this way and never will. The beneficial effects of this product depend on the placebo effect. If you believe something will benefit you because you have read many + testimonials there is a very good chance you will experience a benefit. Of course drinking a potion and expecting to, and then feeling better is a piece of cake compared to the potion actually curing cancer or healing an ulcer. You wouldn't want to go to your doctor when you are very sick and get a placebo. FRS depends on + comments of users and the celebrity endorsement of one of the greatest athletes in history. Does Lance say he won the Tour de France because of FRS? If he did would that be cheating?<br />Cleaves M. Bennett MD"

This made sense till I read the ingredient label on the product. It lists sugar and non dairy creamer as the first ingredients. I was under the impression that the order was for flavored powder and that I would be adding my own sweetener and creamer powder. I am diabetic so I am unable to use this with sugar in it. Both the product description and the directions for preparation are extremely sketchy. If I were to take the product I was sent and prepare it with the directions I was given it would be nothing but sugar and creamer. I paid well over $40 with the high shipping cost for a 2.3 lb. bag of sugar and creamer that I could have purchased at the grocery store for about $3. That is robbery."

8076,"Karl A. Jeney ""writer, dreamer, idealist""",1,"I write this letter after considerable thought and anguish.  On Friday morning, February 25, 2011, I was awakened by the screams of my fianc&eacute;e Lori as she sat on the living room floor cradling Greta, our 2 ½ year-old registered female Pug.  Greta crawled under the coffee table and there choked to death alone on a Purina Busy Bone.<br /><br />I'm left wondering how Purina, a company with a name as iconic as Betty Crocker, Bayer, Gerber and General Mills, could have not only manufactured such a lethal product, but, as I've since discovered on the Internet, has had issues with it in the deaths of other dogs for some time - and not pulled this dangerous item from the shelves.  I find this absolutely appalling.  I'm 57 years-old and I've put my trust in Purina products since I was a child.  And now our beloved Greta, purchased from a breeder as an adorable puppy in the fall of 2008, is dead because of your product.  And Lori, my sweetheart of 32 years, a stroke victim in 2004 and who most certainly can do without this kind of stressful catastrophe; a great animal lover, has had her heart torn asunder.  She's simply devastated - and angry.  And so am I.<br /> Did you know that in the United States its citizens spend more on their pets than their children?  Are you familiar with the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show series which includes the world's finest breeds in competition for ""Best in Show,"" including the Chinese Pug?  Do you have any idea of the loss we've suffered at your negligent hands?<br /> I could talk about the money we paid for Greta from the breeder, and having her spayed (we don't breed our beloved pets; we keep them as loving companions for as long as we can).  And there are the regular check-ups, and shots and so on.  I find it bitterly ironic that the veterinary office we use is within walking distance of the Kroger store from which we purchased your killing Busy Bone.<br /> I have a 91 year-old father who lives alone.  I visit him at least twice a week, sometimes more if time allows.  He certainly appreciates those visits.  But he also has a fulltime companion - Spencer, his Jack Russell terrier.  Spencer will turn 12 in May.  Dad is disabled, uses a walker, is scheduled for heart-valve replacement surgery at the Cleveland Clinic, and has a myriad of other health issues.  Yet despite them he has managed to take very good care of his dog.  And I believe if it weren't for the loving attention Spencer gives dad, he would not be alive today.  His dog has given him something special - the gift of life.  Something which Purina has stolen away from us.  You'd think that Purina would have the same consideration for the welfare of dogs in this country as a disabled 91 year-old man.  But tragically that's not the case.<br /> Yet there's more.  We also have a male pug which we named Winston because he has the same tenacious bulldog features etched into his amazing face as that of Winston Churchill.  Winston, like Greta was, is truly an individual - a soulful companion.  And like us, he's now subdued.  He's actually depressed because his playmate has disappeared and he doesn't understand why.  This concerns me.<br /> I am a professional photographer and writer by trade.  I work with the general public and I have to present a side to it which instills confidence.  Writing, by nature, requires a certain state of mind as well.  As a result of losing Greta, all I can think about now is me handing her a Busy Bone, not knowing that it would snatch her away from us forever a short while later.  The guilt is killing me.  How can I write?  How can I do anything?  Grief passes they say.  But tragic memories remain fixed for a lifetime.  And what makes things worse in this case is that Greta's death could have been prevented.<br /> Though both Winston and Greta liked the Busy Bone, several times in the past Greta had gagged on it.  So, I served her a smaller portion each time, which, after careful observation I assumed resolved the problem.  In retrospect I should have responded more to the concerns Lori expressed over this potential danger to begin with.  In a brief moment, while we were in another room, Greta died because of your product.  And why should such a product even exist?  Why wasn't it at least labeled as a choking hazard?  Why didn't Purina conduct the adequate safety research before releasing this product to the stores?<br /> The answer is self-evident: Gross negligence.  A negligence which has caused the death of not only our beloved Greta and other dogs, but has now indelibly left its mark in Lori's and my life.  We'll never be able to erase the painful images seared into our minds of her lying still on the floor.  I lie awake at night thinking about it now, as well as remembering digging her grave in our backyard through such anguish that even I, a writer, cannot express in words.  It's now the closest we can get to our special friend.  We are utterly distraught.  Greta, only 2 ½ years-old, healthy and in her prime, a wonderful, loving companion, is gone forever.  It's a horrid loss that cannot be replaced - thanks to Purina.<br /> The very least Purina can do is pull all forms of the Busy Bone from the market immediately, and to conduct adequate, responsible research in the future before releasing any Purina product.<br /><br /> Karl and Lori<br /> Former owners of beloved Greta, purebred female pug.  Our baby.  Gone forever."

And it has Autolyzed Yeast Extract which is another name for the infamous neurotoxin....MSG (monosodium glutamate). I don't understand why this well known company has to use dangerous ingredients when there are so many substitutes that will not destroy our populations health.  Is it purely because it's so much cheaper to use these dangerous, life threatening products that they only see their profit margins and not the health of the nation.

The only thing that looked like Christmas candy, was the ribbon shape.<br /><br />When I was a kid I remember my mother buying ribbon candy and they looked like the box photo and had rich flavors like the above, but also spicy flavors of wintergreen, peppermint, and anise and hot cinnamon. The current boring lemon, lime, orange, weak cinnamon, and an indistinguishable flavor in white ribbon, are not worth the money. Buy a cheap bag of suckers and save your money.<br /><br />If they still make other flavors they should package 12 shorter ribbons of mixed variety instead of 6 longer ribbons of common lollypop flavors."

12254,Terry Wolff,1,"I have been feeding these to our dog for years to help her with her joints, especially her hips. Ever since I started her on these as a treat, meaning I gave her one in the morning and another in the evening she regained her active self and they helped her get interested in her regular meals. It was a win, win situation for our finicky eater.<br /><br />However, I would like to note, that when I started her on these treats, they were being made in the USA. Resentfully I discovered that they are now produced in China. As we know, China produces some very high end products and some real crap as well. However, when it comes to food products that come from overseas a warning flag goes up in my mind, especially if they are coming from China. Personally I never noticed anything odd with our 14 year old dog's reaction to Happy Hips. Still, I decided that I did not want to subject her to a food product coming out of China.<br /><br />Does anyone know of another product like Happy Hips with Glucosamine (for the joints) in it, that is produced in the USA?"

She received her first shipment today and none of the 4 ice creams that were sent matched the sheet they included explaining the ice creams (you could have bought several of the ice creams, such as butter pecan or mint chocolate chip, in your local grocery store).  When I called the 800 number I was told that occasionally they reserve the right to change the ice cream if it doesn't ""meet their quality"" guidelines.  When I told her none of the four ice creams that we received matched the overview sheet from amazingclubs, the customer service rep was rude and told me that I needed to call back and talk to someone in their ""support group"" (note: you must call before 6:00 PM EST to speak to someone in this group).

I am in the process of filing complaints and trying to get this fixed, but considering that another person posted with the same problem, I am suspecting that this is something of a scam.  If it isn't a scam, then they have poor quality control for their shipping.<br /><br />The single package I got looked good and was foil wrapped.  Unfortunately I can't eat it until the dispute is resolved.

540833,z_bookworm,1,"New edit:  This is really annoying.  I posted this review for the ""Natural Light"" variety, and it was originally on that page.  Now that the ""Natural Light"" was discontinued, they moved my review to this version where it doesn't apply.  However it is still true that the company which purchased Orville Redenbacher, ConAgra, no longer is making a less salty, 3.5oz/bag popcorn with unrefined palm oil.  This is a shame as no one else is either.  Despite what amazon.com has been doing, this is not an acceptable substitute for the other product and shouldn't be sent without permission to people who had the ""Natural Light"" on subscription delivery.  And after over a year of complaints, the bag size in the description should have been corrected.  Amazon.com, this is really shoddy behavior, and leads me to think it is a matter of mega-companies sticking together to scam customers out of our hard-earned cash.<br /><br />This review has been edited to reflect the mfr.'s change of the product.<br /><br />When I first reviewed this popcorn, I was describing the popcorn as it was in 2006.  It was made w/ very healthy unrefined palm oil containing nutritious beta-carotene and no trans fats.  It was also 3.5oz per bag.<br /><br />The mfr. has degraded the product.  It's now made w/ partially hydrogenated soy oil that has trans fat, and they've shrunk the bag to 2.9oz..  It's not any healthier or tastier than econo-brands now, but it is still much more expensive.  You also have to cook it for less time than is printed on the bag b/c of the smaller amount or it will burn.<br /><br />Whenever a good product is cheapened like this I always do an online search to see if the company was acquired, and sure enough, ConAgra bought Orville Redenbacher.  If you scan the reviews you'll see that almost all the 5-star reviews were written before 2007.  So don't bother complaining to the company about the decline in quality, b/c they don't care."

148988,nicole,1,"First thing I must say is the cutover service is great. Lillianna and Nancy are very nice (the fact that I know there names is redic). However, as much as I wanted this product to work! After my 2nd machine and my 3rd bowl I'm giving up. Nancy asked for another shot (this is not the first time she's asked) but this time I declined. I wanted to give them a shot I really did but there have been way to many errors, so I thought you all should know. I am a big review person so I had to put this out there.<br /><br />We bought our machine directly from their site. First machine out of the box tiny plastic piece on bowl lid BROKEN. Get a new bowl. Finally get to use the machine, water leaks EVERYWHERE and after steaming no blending happening. A new machine arrived. 1st use - steam but no blend again, but no water yay lol. I gave it another shot, worked good. Yesterday, couldn't get my blade off and drive shaft was stuck. Now, at this point i have 3 bowls sitting around - but I was just TIRED of this machine.<br /><br />READ THIS PART @ LEAST:<br />This machine has a great concept, steam and blend all in one without going back to hit another button - perfect, I thought, until I got the manual. There is actually only about 5 foods that you can actually do this with!!! (i wish i would have known this) All the others have water issues. So for instance, I think it was apples, they have too much water after steaming so you have to go and strain the water before blending...so whats the point? Along with this when you blend manually you have to stand there and hold the button in! I've decided I'm not that lazy and I can go back and hit a steam button - but I am a multitasked so standing over the machine to hold the button in, well, sucks!<br /><br />Taking it apart and getting the blade out is rather difficult (and as u can see from above sometimes the darn thing doesn't even come out). My mind always slipped and i wanted to get my food out of the bowl - but to take the blade out it needs to be attached to the base, so I would have to put it back on and get the blade out.<br /><br />Also, difficult to put the bowl back on the base @ times. The gaskets have to be lined up or there is no luck.<br /><br /> I am using filtered water and I am still getting mineral deposits in the water tank after first use, hmmm?<br /><br />Overall, too many flaws, too many manufacturing errors, time to buy a beaba.

147141,R. Gonzales,1,"This gum have is an outrage!  It worst than Coke Cola.<br /><br />  ""When launched Coca-Cola's two key ingredients were cocaine (benzoylmethyl ecgonine) and caffeine. The cocaine was derived from the coca leaf and the caffeine from kola nut, leading to the name Coca-Cola (the ""K"" in Kola was replaced with a ""C"" for marketing purposes).[29][30]<br />Coca -- cocaine<br /><br />Pemberton called for five ounces of coca leaf per gallon of syrup, a significant dose; in 1891, Candler claimed his formula (altered extensively from Pemberton's original) contained only a tenth of this amount. Coca-Cola did once contain an estimated nine milligrams of cocaine per glass, but in 1903 it was removed.[31] Coca-Cola still contains coca flavoring.""<br /><br />I have read in Wikipedia, that Pemberton was a morphine junkie.  This man, a junkie, was allowed to formulate the formula for coca cola.  What a low down standard. I know when someone is hooked on something, they don't know the different between right and wrong, healthy and unhealthy and cannot be trusted.  It is a fact, that drug addicts are contagious, they spread diseases and just being around they bad behavior cause other people (who are not skilled to treat) to use bad drugs too.  Even thought this drink was latter said to be ""kosher"" by a rabbi.  I still will not drink it because the acid contain is so high it can dissolve a nail and the manufacturers of Coke Cola cannot put enough distance between me and the words cocaine free cola leaf.<br /><br />People happily smacking on this gum today, shows how America values have deteriorated over the last 100 years.  Most consumers, do not care that their are exhilarates in their food, even to the point they are defending the bad products in the food.  It seems like the phenylalanine is working, same as trying to tell junkie."

Federal organic standards prohibit the use of all synthetic/petrochemical solvents"".<br /><br />Martek Biosciences was able to dodge the ban on hexane-extraction by claiming USDA does not consider omega-3 and omega-6 fats to be ""agricultural ingredients."" Therefore, they argue, the ban against hexane extraction does not apply. The USDA helped them out by classifying those oils as ""necessary vitamins and minerals,"" which are exempt from the hexane ban. But hexane-extraction is just the tip of the iceberg. Other questionable manufacturing practices and misleading statements by Martek included:<br /><br />Undisclosed synthetic ingredients, prohibited for use in organics (including the sugar alcohol mannitol, modified starch, glucose syrup solids, and ""other"" undisclosed ingredients)<br />Microencapsulation of the powder and nanotechnology, which are prohibited under organic laws<br />Use of volatile synthetic solvents, besides hexane (such as isopropyl alcohol)<br />Recombinant DNA techniques and other forms of genetic modification of organisms; mutagenesis; use of GMO corn as a fermentation medium<br />Heavily processed ingredients that are far from ""natural""<br /><br />quote from: Why is this Organic Food Stuffed With Toxic Solvents? by Dr. Mercola - GOOGLE GMOs found in Martek.<br /><br />This is the latest I have found on DHA in organic and non organic baby food/ formula:<br />AT LEAST READ THIS ONE*** GOOGLE- False Claims That DHA in Organic and Non-Organic Infant Formula Is Safe. AND OrganicconsumersDOTorg<br /><br />Martek's patents for Life'sDHA states: ""includes mutant organisms"" and ""recombinant organisms"", (a.k.a. GMOs!) The patents explain that the oil is ""extracted readily with an effective amount of solvent ... a preferred solvent is hexane.""<br /><br />The patent for Life'sARA states: ""genetically-engineering microorganisms to produce increased amounts of arachidonic acid"" and ""extraction with solvents such as ... hexane."" Martek has many other patents for DHA and ARA. All of them include GMOs. GMOs and volatile synthetic solvents like hexane aren't allowed in USDA Organic products and ingredients.<br /><br />Tragically, Martek's Life'sDHA is already in hundreds of products, many of them certified USDA Organic. Please demand that the National Organic Standards Board reject Martek's petition, and that the USDA National Organic Program inform the company that the illegal 2006 approval is rescinded and that their GMO, hexane-extracted Life'sDHA and Life'sARA are no longer allowed in organic products.<br /><br />BUT I went to the lifesdha website and THEY DO NOT DISCLOSE HOW THEY MAKE THEIR LifesDHA!!!

(As an aside, what on earth is the purpose of that orange juice, which exists in less quantity than the caramel color. )<br /><br />In other words, this concoction is apples, drenched in high-fructose corn syrup and regular corn syrup, with a few raisins.  Lord knows what the ""spices"" were, because they could scarcely be distinguished under the sickly aftertaste of corn syrup.<br /><br />Here are the ingredients from a recipe for real mincemeat, again in order of volume:  apples, raisins, beef (for those who like it), sultanas, currents, sour cherries, citrons, sugar, strawberry preserves, apricot preserves, orange peel, lemon peel, spices (cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, mace, allspice), salt.  This mixture is marinated in liquor - rum, brandy, sherry, apple jack, or whatever additional or alternative liquor you may enjoy.  Our family's recipe calls for these things; other people use different fruits, most omit the meat, some use juice and vinegar instead of liquor.

I have been ordering these bully sticks from Rawhide Depot for quite some time and have never been disappointed before. There is usually one in the package that could be better but on the whole they have aways been an acceptable size.  These are priced very well.  I cannot afford to buy them anywhere else. My doggies may have to do without. I may take a chance again in the future but if I receive the same incredibly skinny ones I will never buy them again. The shipping was fast and there were no other glitches.

At first, I thought it was the canned food that I give him once a day, but he had had no problems with it before. I stopped giving him canned food anyway, and only gave him Healthy Naturals. He continued to have loose stools, and this continued for a few days after I had stopped giving him the Healthy Naturals. It was horrible! My whole apartment stank of cat poop, and I had to wipe and clean his rear end everytime he used the litterbox or there'd be stains everywhere he sat! I don't know, but maybe it just doesn't suit his digestive system. I've had him since he was 7 weeks old and he has never had diarrhea until I fed him this dry food.

406540,Stephen Ashley Blake,1,"I'm something of a tea fanatic, drinking a small pot first thing every morning.  At any given time, I have a variety of about fifty teas of various kinds and/or brands to choose from.  Having had delicious Kenya Milima Estate tea before and loved it, I was eager to try this brand at this great price.<br /><br />What a disappointment.  This tea is by far the most weak and relatively flavorless I've ever had.  I don't exaggerate to write that I'd rather have an ordinary cup of Lipton's tea than this."
323578,"CG ""Teacher""",1,"I like seaweed in dishes, so I thought I'd try this snack. I had to spit it out and use mouthwash to get the stinky dead fish taste out of my mouth. And the texture was not at all crunchy - I felt like I had put shaved fish skin in my mouth. I really wanted to like this snack, but it was one of the worst things I've ever tasted, and I am not a picky eater."
13968,Domingo Tavella,1,"The nose evokes the earthiness of white truffles, just barely.  The white truffle presence in Bartolini is weak with mineral (almost chemical) notes, not the earthy, warm and almost intoxicating fragrance you expect from white truffles.<br /><br />There is no such thing as white truffles (oil or otherwise) on a budget.  The real thing is expensive, a deserving price for the experience you expect."
384379,D. Figueroa,1,"The J in this must stand for HFCS or something. There is NO fruit whatsoever in these dry, dusty, horrible little crackers.<br /><br />Didn't help that they arrived almost pulverised, either.<br /><br />We've liked other Austin crackers, but these are simply horrible. It appears that they put a wafer-thin layer of peanut butter, then some sort of artificially flavored sugar mixture on it.<br /><br />I wish Amazon had published the ingredients first, I wouldn't have ordered them. Have requested a refund."

It's not safe for use if you have young animals or children running around. This should have been mentioned on the page, instead I had to wait til I received the product to find out. At a $10 nonrefundable shipping price and no reimbursement for costs to send it back, it costs more to try to return it than to just keep it."
401440,Morning Joy,1,"This is my second purchase from Pacific Natural Foods. While I loved the Poblano Corn soup, I didn't care for this one at all and neither did my husband. We both agreed there is a very strange aftertaste that lingers after each bite--not enjoyable for either one of us. In fact, I just refused to eat the rest of my portion. Neither one of us could identify exactly what that aftertaste was. I guessed perhaps the lemongrass was the culprit, completely overpowering the flavor of the soup, but my dh said it tasted like chemicals. Who knows? I suggest for those looking to buy in bulk and have never tried the Thai Sweet Potato soup, definitely go buy 1 box from your local store's natural food section so you're not wasting your hard earned money if you end up not liking it."

It's simply a scoop or so of the Muscle Milk powder with some wimpy, fine oatmeal flakes.  Add a little bit of hot water and you've got a super pasty extra strong, hot, pungent soup of protein powder and oatmeal.  I couldn't eat the six-pack obviously, so I gave to some friends to try... every verdict from everyone was that it was terrible.  I'd give it 0 stars if I could."

Notice that this product title starts with ""Alaskan Salmon"", minor quib, but ...<br /><br />My order consists of 4 cans of ""Grained Salmon Caviar""  looks and smells nothing like the sushi restaurant roe.  A lot of the eggs were crushed I'd say around 80% to 90%.  The ones I get from the sushi restaurants are all intact little bubbles.  It might be because its concentrate, but I don't remember the Roe in the restaurants smelling like olives. I don't like olives<br /><br />The can labels are russian but I can see ""made in USA"" and made on March 28, 2011.  This contradicts with description of 2 week shelf life.  So this product has already been expired, possibly they mean when its opened.  It was September when I received it.  I was a bit turned off by the large difference in ship and made date.<br /><br />The order arrived a day later than expected.  That is fine however it was only shipped after I inquired its status.  The shipper said he/she was ""sorry I was out of town"".  The product was pack tightly, but the ice pack that was packed with has already melted by the time I got it (I opened the package immediately upon receiving, knowing it was perishable).<br /><br />This is the first time I ordered Salmon Roe, perhaps they all come like this.

Healthy,I'm sure,but not of the ""tastes good and good for you too"" ilk. There's nothing distinctively Southwestern about it either--like using black beans and blue corn. Fantastic World Foods' Southwestern Chili is not only better, but it's edible and its spiciness it punchy. Avoid this one. It probably is better as compost."
175552,Zekesgirl,1,"I bought this because I had heard good things about it. I was so disappointed when I finally got to try it.  It was so bitter tasting, not at all what I had expected. I started out with a very minimal amount because I had been told that it was sweeter than sugar, I had to keep adding more and even then all I could taste was the bitterness.  A few weeks later I was talking to a co-worker who also majored in chemistry etc., and she said that whether or not you like the taste depends on your chemical makeup, so some people find it very sweet and love it and others find it bitter and hate it.  Just my luck that I was in the latter crowd!! It was pricey for such a small bottle and since I can't use it, it was a complete waste of money."

It's the only beverage aside from water that my husband will drink.<br /><br />Going back to when I met him --- He would buy regular Kool-Aid and add all the sugar.  Once I came into the picture, I turned him on to the Sugar Free version.  He LOVED it.  Then, in seemed like ""all of a sudden"" the grocery stores quit carrying the cherry flavor.<br /><br />I did an internet search and found the Cherry Sugar Free Kool-Aid on Amazon.  Perfect shipping. Other reviews have mentioned the powder being chunky or hard to break up.  While we did experience that on our first shipment almost a year ago, we have since enountered it.<br /><br />I don't drink Cherry Kool-Aid.

Further, the texture is like soft plastic filled with elmer's glue. Nevermind the bad taste, the texture is so gross you won't want to eat these.

454835,A. Fondale,1,"One of my daughter's closest friends is on a GF diet, so for my daughter's birthday party I purchased this cake mix instead of giving her friend a separate treat. This was only my second time trying a gluten free mix, but I was dissatisfied with the results. We followed the directions exactly and made half (24) as mini-cupcakes and half (12) as regular cupcakes. The batter was evenly divided and all the cups were filled the same. Yet, the batter expanded and spilled out when it was cooking, then while they cooled they flattened out with a concave dip in the center. The next morning I tried to frost them, but they were so sticky that dark, cupcake sludge stuck to the frosting. We're not talking heavy frosting either, a light whip cream frosting. When they were served, no one ate more than a single bite and put them down. Usually the kids (4-8 years old) will eat anything sweet, but they all spit it out on their plates. The adults were polite enough to swallow. The final texture was a slippery sweet sludge on top, firm and springy on the bottom, and a grittiness that may be typical of rice flour, (I had noticed the same grittiness in the otherwise delicious bread mix from another company)."

For the most part Amazon's prices are in line and are competitive, but sometimes they run too far into left field and run head first into the wall.

400799,Silea,1,"To test this product, i sprinkled a layer onto an area of my yard that one of my cats has taken to using as his private litter box. It's bare dirt, dry, sheltered from the wind.<br /><br />I used about half of the package, which claims to cover 300 square feet, on this area that's approximately 75 square feet. I didn't intend to overdose it so badly, but it's very hard to estimate how much you're shaking out over what square footage. (In case you don't feel like doing the math, that means i used about twice as much per square foot as the packaging says is necessary.)<br /><br />Day 1: The cat went to his new favorite toilet, sniffed around, and meandered off. I didn't see him set foot in that space all day.<br /><br />Day 2: The cat went to his new favorite toilet, dug a hole, and did his business.<br /><br />So even at double strength, this product deterred a housecat for all of approximately one day. One windless, rainless day. That hardly seems like something worth spending money on.<br /><br />And speaking of money, you're paying for something that is, by weight, less than 1% active ingredients. That means about 0.8 ounces of this product is important, and the rest is filler. And those active ingredients are basically black pepper and a little bit of something like cayenne pepper. You can buy a 2-3 ounce container of black pepper at any grocery store for a few dollars, so why pay more than $20 for this? Even if it worked, it would be a waste of money."

163894,Dan Huse,1,"Sometimes, I am a sucker for the new stuff, and this is one fine example.  In my quest to drink more water, I sought out flavorings.  My perception of this product is quite different from the reality I experienced after buying it.<br /><br />Being a marketing professional myself, I think I have this gimmick figured out perfectly.  If only I had not fallen for it, I would feel a lot better.  So, here is how the gimmick goes:<br /><br />1. Rather than selling consumers perfectly portioned pouches of flavored powder, such as those sold under the Crystal Light brand and other brands, sell it to them in liquid form and claim that is has 24 servings inside.  This makes it seem like a good value per serving, but a ""serving"" is a meaningless measure, as consumers will squirt and squirt and squirt some more to get enough flavoring.  The bottle doesn't say how many squirts is 1 serving.  Rest assured, consumers will use far more than 1 serving at a time, and they will never know how many servings they really get from the bottle.<br /><br />2. Since a squirt bottle can come in only one flavor, consumers will have to buy lots of bottles, rather than just a nice variety pack of the single-serve Crystal Light or similar packets.  This ""pantry loading"", as they call it, not only leads to higher sales up front, but it also locks in the consumer, who feels wedded to his investment.<br /><br />3. Tell the consumer on the package that the contents should be used within 30 days of opening the bottle.  This will make consumers either (a) throw it out for fear that it has gone bad or (b) use it up faster to prevent if from going bad.  Either way, this means more sales from new sales.<br /><br />Interestingly, this product is made by the same company that sells Crystal Light--Kraft Foods.  This tells me they are not satisfied with certain aspects of Crystal Light, such as the fact that others make generic versions and sell them more cheaply.  Hence, they have created a product that competes with Crystal Light, in hopes that at least some of them will switch, leading to enhanced profitability and less competition from those pesky alternatives in powder form."
390583,D. Richman,1,"When you pick these retriever rolls up, and hold them in your hand, they feel very lightweight. I didn't think much about it until today, when I decided to saw one in half so that my dog could have a quick chewy treat. The outside the roll looked perfect -- they appear to be densely rolled rawhides. But, upon looking inside the roll I discovered that THE ROLL WAS A HOLLOW TUBE!<br /><br />These rolls are very deceptive. You could give hundreds of these to your dogs and not realize that there is very little rawhide in them.<br /><br />Whoever rolled the hides simply rolled an external hide once around two thin strips of rawhides into the end of the rolls to make them look like a long length of hide had been rolled up tight (imagine a thin coil of rawhide neatly stuffed into each end of the roll). To make matters worse, there seems to be some kind of spray foam used as an adhesive to keep it all together.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and find a high quality US rawhide company that ships to your local pet store."

It was if anything worse, it tasted simply awful, like it was spoiled somehow.  Now there's no expiration or production date on the packages that I could find, only a copyright date of 2009.  I don't know whether this is the way it normally tastes (I can't really imagine that), or if it was a bad batch, or had simply spoiled somehow, but I think it was likely one of the two latter options.  I am not keen, however, on paying money to try this again.  Amazon was kind enough to refund my purchase price.<br /><br />I'm a regular coffee drinker (4+ cups/day) and have brewed two pots a day for going on 25 years for the family.  I'm a big fan of chocolate coffees and other flavored coffees, and I've not experienced any coffee remotely like what was in this package."
341815,Mr. M,1,I asked my Dad to honestly tell me what he thought about the steaks I sent him for x-mas. He told me the ribeyes were small and thin. He had to cook all of them for a meal for 2. He also said the flavor was just okay. I'm glad he was honest with me because I don't want to waste money on something that he isn't going to enjoy.

I would never buy them at a grocery store."

I hated them so much I had to come on here and write a review. They are absolutely terrible. The sauce is thin and doesnt really taste like anything at all.  There are scales all though the sauce and on the sardines. The scales get in your teeth and all through your mouth. I felt like I was biting into an uncooked trout. Don't buy these.<br />Sticking with the Beach Cliff brand sardines, much better."

Not only was it not the same format I had as a child (we had something about the diameter of a regular tootsie roll, and about 6"" long, whereas this was about 3 to 4 times that diameter and could be broken into 4 sections), but it did NOT have the same taste at all. I know we sometimes inflate the wonderfulness of things in our memories, but this was definitely not the same thing we had as children. I'm not sure if this is just a different thing altogether, or if this is a poor remake of that, but I was very disappointed. It didn't taste horrible, but it sort of tasted like it had had itself been around since the 70s and was similar to any high-protein bar around -- definitely NOT worth the price!"

Purina has changed the recipe, and its hard to find the old formula that was made with yogurt. My cat has a sensitive stomach and has thrown up all foods we have tried besides the type made with yogurt. Now that the recipe has changed, he is throwing up daily again. I was so excited to see I could buy the yogurt version on AMAZON in bulk... till it arrived. This is not the product I wanted, the picture is very misleading considering their disclaimer says that all ingredients may not be listed on the site. Its on the picture so I thought I would get what I saw."

This stuff comes covered in a greasy, slimy coating.  After trying hard to get passed that, on to the actual jerky...it's not chewy, like jerky is supposed to be, it is too easy to bite off a piece.  And the flavor is beyond description, in a bad way.  I've tried almost all of the flavors now, and would never buy ANY of them again.  They have a weird perfumey taste.  So, they're slimy and taste awful.  That about sums it up."

I love some of the other Wholesome Sweetener products, particularly the dark brown sugar, but this one is lumpy, tasteless, and grey! Looks and tastes like spackle. Have to sift to remove the mothball-like clumps. I get fooled by this stuff about once a year around the holidays when I'm feeling all joy to the world and making baked goods with organic ingredients I can afford about once a year. And then I remember: organic powdered sugar is kind of like organic Cheeteos. If you're going to do it, might as well go with the real thing. You'll be twice s happy and spend about half as much."

8519,EB,1,Probably because it doesn't taste like coffee.  It is flavorless.  I saw the good reviews and thought I'd get a couple boxes and now I'm stuck with a bunch of k cups that I don't want to drink because I'd rather literally drink any other k cup I've ever tried.

But this one- NOPE.  Not sure where the positive reviews are coming from honestly...

It didn't even smell like coffee.  I used top setting because I don't like super strong coffee.  Still did not smell like coffee, smells like mud.  Pretty much tasted like mud also.  Bitter mud.  I will try one more on different setting before throwing them away.  BUT they also jam in the cup holder thing.  Bottom came out fine but top was jammed in and took quite a bit of manuevering to get it loose.  NOT A HAPPY CAMPER."
142915,George B. Singer,1,"Cafe Bustelo releases a stale, pungent aroma when the can's seal is broken: you are forewarned by an odor reminiscent of Maxwell House or perhaps Folger's that has been ground together with cigarette butts.  Draw a demitasse of espresso and you can either 1) dissolve the enamel off your teeth by drinking it or 2) water it down to Americano strength where it will merely taunt you, daring you to drink it even when you know you shouldn't.  This is honestly the worst espresso I've ever tasted.  No body, excessive acidity and bitterness, unpleasant chemical aftertaste.  Yes, it's cheap - but the more important question is: are you?"

I am so disappointed in Necco's misguided decision to change their classic Sweethearts conversation hearts. Once a great traditional candy they're now just gross. They changed all the flavors, eliminated the white ones all together (which as luck would have it, were my favorites) and changed the nice crunchy texture to a soft disintegrating mess. Bleck. What a huge mistake. Why change a trusty classic? Why not just make a new candy?"

I've purchased a lot of different types of dried fruits, and I'm not sure why this one has the weird smell.  It's not anything that will make you sick, but still just strange and not pleasant."

Yes, the flavor is good for instant coffee, but if I wanted instant, I wouldn't have the machine. There are tiny instant granules in each pod pack, and the hot water runs through and dissolves the granules. Pull out the pod the wrong way and you get a drippy, coffee goo mess on your hands. Yuck!"

This new formula has a gritty hard dry texture, does not stay crunchy in milk like the old formula, and it taste artificially sweet.  The old formula had a great malty, honey like flavor and stayed crunchy in milk longer.  I would go out of my way to buy it, special ordering it in cases from my health food store because they didn't carry this one at the store and it's so hard to find cereals without wheat.  But now with this new formula ... forget it, I will no longer be buying it. Health Valley ruined a good thing!"

It's a great product, just not when contaminated - so good luck with the patch you receive (it is from China after all)."
269808,DW,1,"Usually I don't bother to review products, but in this case I feel consumers should know that they're getting. I recently bought a jar of Polaner All Fruit with Fiber Raspberry jelly. The strange thing was it didn't taste like raspberry, nor did it taste good. I finally looked at the ingredients list, and found the following: Juce concentrates (pear, grape), maltodextrin, raspberries, fruit pectin, natural flavoring, citric acid. Raspberry was third down on the list, after maltodextrin.<br /><br />What I was tasting and had paid a premium price for was grape jelly! I thought Polaner produced premium products. No where on the front label did they say grape and pear were the predominant fruit. To my view, false advertising."

We did as instructed with this toy last night and sat with our Pit/Mastif 17month old puppy named Daisy.  She loved it and today we went out for two hours to look at homes to buy.  When we returned she did her usual running around and greeting us with her new toy in her mouth.  Several minutes later she was laying at our feet with her toy still there.  While reaching out to grab the toy and play with her it was stuck.  I mean stuck.  She had literally gotten her entire lower jaw stuck in the hole that you take in and out to place the food into.  Not a tooth not a hair, her entire jaw.  I cannot believe that this is the first occurance for this toy.  It definately needs some redesign or removal from market.  This toy has cut a ring around her jaw to the point of bleeding and massive swelling because of how it was lodged.  We bought the large version as HELLO we have a large dog.  If you really care for your pet, look elsewhere for a toy that does keep them entertained when you are not around.  It kept our baby entertained alright.  But she couldn't eat or drink as she walked around with a 6 inch cube stuck to the front of her face.  We feel pathetic that we did this to her."

The lack of actual chai tea flavor & the fact that I hate black licorice makes these pods a big disappointment. I've tried adding the CBTL french vanilla powder to a cup of this tea along with some milk to create a chai tea latte. Although doing that helps cover up the licorice flavor & makes the chai tea drinkable, it still doesn't taste very good. I'll stick with my Oregon Chai Tea Latte powder mix for making an instant chai tea latte.<br /><br />Another con - these pods (actually, all of the tea pods) leave tons of grounds in the bottom of the coffee mug when they are brewed.<br /><br />I realize the Kaldi was only recently launched, but I hope The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf plans on introducing more pod flavors in the future (an Earl Grey and a jasmine green tea flavor would be nice, along with hot chocolate pods)."

Several have been infested by mold and unfortunately I took a bite before realizing this. They are not expired and I don't know why they are this way. I would send them back but there is no contact phone number that i can find for amazon and they do not return food products so i wasted $50 on these oat bars... has anyone else had this problem? Don't buy them they are not fresh!

428741,Georgie Lowery,1,"I'm always looking out for shelf stable foods that I can heat and eat in a hurry. I still haven't found it. I bought a six pack of these and I don't even think I'll donate the remaining five to a food bank. They're just that nasty. The flavor is, well, not chickeny. The chicken is rubbery something and not chickeny, either. The instant potatoes somehow have lumps and I'm pretty sure the gravy is just for color. Oh, man. I can't, in good conscience, give this to the dog to eat."
45602,Gayla M. Collins,1,"Let me preface to say I have had dire stomach issues since a small child.  Acid reflux corrodes my insides and often times I turn to Ginger-Ale when I can consume nothing else.  But, as we know, Ginger-Ale has lots of sugar, a load of sodium and a great deal of carbonation.  When I spotted, ""Ginger Kili All Natural Ginger and Lemon Beverage"" I thought I had found a wonderful solution.  My doctor had even suggested sucking on ginger lozenges that are at a available at health food stores.  I thought I had one-upped him with this product.<br /><br />Happily, I brewed the hot water just knowing that I would love the combination ginger, lemon and honey.  I am deeply fond of all those tastes.  I poured it into my cup of boiling water, allowed to cool a bit and drank a hearty sip.  Oh my goodness, I have never tasted anything so vile since that horrid cod-liver oil that still haunts my memories of childhood.  This is just awful.<br /><br />I will NOT be finishing the cup of Gold Kili nor will I ever buy another package.<br /><br />I hope others find it soothing.....I can't get that awful taste out of my mouth."

I put together my pennies, literally, to buy these and this seller ripped me off.  I will never buy anything like this from amazon again.

The lable suggests that feeding your animal this product will make their waste firmer and less frequent.  That part was certainly true. Unfortunately the ingredients in this food are shown by a variety of other websites to cause allergic reactions or worse in animals.  After a visit to the vet's office to treat a severe case of rash, ear-ache,itching and loss of pet hair in my cat Frisky I did a web search and tried to contact natural life pet products.  No response has come from the company, but I was able to find an article about the RECALL of this product from national chain stores last month because of possible instances of pet death.  Don't feed this to your pet if you love them."
141189,DUDLEY NIGHTSHADE,1,"These are like most other traditional Japanese sweets - a derivative of Chinese sweets that have had all the flavour taken out.<br />The azuki one looks innocuous enough, but the texture is rather disgusting. It looks smooth, but in fact contains rough skins of the beans, and once that shock has passed, you're left with a kind of bland earthy flavour offset by mild sweetness. Why would anyone eat this anymore, this strikes me as a food for poverty-stricken times."

I don't think I've ever tasted anything this awful in my life. The noodles were difficult to even separate with a fork according to the instructions. Once that was finally done and I poured the dark brown goop ""sauce"" into the box and heated it up, the office stunk like spicy armpits! Even worse was the actual taste! The noodles were hard and rubbery and the sauce was really salty. I threw it away immediately!!! HORRIBLE!!!"

It has such a terrible after taste, that I would have given up coffee all together if this stuff was the only product I could use.  I still have two bottles that I will never touch again.  Luckily, there are other brands that don't come with unwanted taste effects.  I've been using Stirling, and I'm going to try DaVinci.  Monin syrups always taste good as well."

15201,"Portrait of Innocence ""Sweet Cheeks""",1,"I am not a foodie, but I do like to eat.  Some would say that I love to eat.<br /><br />The basics: Each packet contains regular microwave popcorn and an envelope of cheese powder to be sprinkled over the popcorn.<br /><br />Flavor:  The cheese flavor doesn't taste like any cheese that I'd like to eat, if it tastes like cheese at all.  I can't quite place the flavor, but white cheddar?  Not at all.  If real cheese tasted anywhere near this bad, I wouldn't need to go to the gym.  Even people that eat blue cheese would stay away from this stuff.<br />I bought a single package from my grocer thinking: Hey it is only $1.19.  What could I lose?  Well I lost $1.19 plus tax!<br />Flavor is a complete bust.<br /><br />Popcorn:  Nice and fluffy.  If I hadn't sprinkled the mystery powder over all of the popcorn, I would have enjoyed snacking on the plain popped corn. But nooo, in my enthusiasm to finally free myself from the grips of my local gourmet popcorn dealer, I sprinkled the pack of powder on all of the popcorn.  But I digress...  I counted 31 total un-popped or partially popped kernels.  The popcorn would have been awesome if not for the `cheese powder'.  (Of course, your results may vary according to your microwave oven and superior button pushing abilities.)<br /><br />No stars for flavor<br />Five stars for popcorn.<br />Overall: One star. There is no need to pay an upcharge for powder that will render your popcorn inedible."

6452,J. Papernick,1,"I am celiac and have been keeping a strictly gluten-free diet for over six years, and was excited to learn about this product.  After eating it, [the taste and texture was not bad] I became sick in the way that I always do when ingesting gluten. Nana's also makes non-gluten products, and clearly are not careful about cross-contamination.  If you are concerned about ingesting gluten or keeping a strictly celiac diet, I strongly recommend you avoid this product.  I also think that the company should not deceive their customers, many who suffer from celiac disease, and should more clearly label their product as it is a danger to the health of many who would be inclined to buy this product."

125245,muff,1,"I took a risk and ordered the mango flavor, hoping that some of the reviews would be wrong and this product would be as described - that is, a relatively healthy smoothie mix.  Alas, that was not the case.<br /><br />This smoothie mix is basically sugar syrup with maybe (I'm still dubious on this one) a little bit of fruit mixed in.  The mango mix is BRIGHT orange and SICKLY sweet.  They WAY overdid it on the sugar.  I couldn't even finish the first smoothie I made because it was way too sweet.<br /><br />Also, as another reviewer noted (not sure which flavor was being reviewed then), the ingredients for the mango product are also not as listed in the nutritional info on the product page.  I think part of the problem is that the product picture (and probably also nutritional info) are actually for a different product, the MANGO GUAVA flavor.  I ordered and received the MANGO MADNESS product, with no guava listed in the ingredients.  But my main beef is the type and relative amount of sugar was misrepresented.<br /><br />Here are the ingredients and nutritional info from the product page:<br /><br />Ingredients: MANGO PUREE, BEET SUGAR, TEA INFUSION (FILTERED WATER, GREEN TEA), NATURAL MANGO AND GUAVA FLAVORS, VEGETABLE GUM, CITRIC ACID, ASCORBIC ACID (VITAMIN C) YELLOW 6, SODIUM BENZOATE (TO PRESERVE FRESHNESS).<br />Calories 110<br />Total Carbohydrate 28g (9%)<br />Sugars 27g<br /><br />And here is the info from the actual product label:<br /><br />Ingredients: Sugar, water, mango puree concentrate, malic acid, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), natural flavors, green tea powder, potassium sorbate (preservative), sodium benzoate (preservative), cellulose gum, yellow #5, and yellow #6<br />Calories 140<br />Total carbohydrate 36g<br />Sugars 35g<br />Also note that the nutritional info directly above is for 1/4 cup of smoothie base.  Of course, the directions on the side of the bottle instruct you to add 4oz of smoothie base to generate a 16oz serving.  So, you're really getting 54g of sugar in each smoothie.<br /><br />Wish I had received the product that was promised, it sounded like a great product. Instead, I'll be trying to return this if I can.  Very disappointed in this purchase."

Then after tasting it, it  really was a sweet artifical flavor, very chemically not at all like good diet peach ice tea like AZ Ice Tea or Snapple. That's the flavor I was hoping for really. I tried it again and I just can't use this stuff, what a pity because I really wanted it and needed it be good. I would have been a customer if I liked it at all.

267211,Deb in Las Vegas,1,"Just made and tasted a pizza with this yeast.  I have been baking for over 25  years and have made pizza dough the traditional way with excellent results.  I was a bit skeptical of this dough but since it had the Fleishmann name, I gave it a try. I purchased yeast at local supermarket not Amazon.  I followed directions with exact measurements using regular flour.  My sauce was simply crushed tomatoes with basil, salt, garlic powder and olive oil. Topping:  Grated mozzerela cheese. Baked in a pizza pan with holes (provides for crisper crust and can be found in most retail stores)  Prep and cook time:  25 minutes.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Quick to mix<br />Was easy to press onto pizza pan<br />A great time saver for busy familys<br />Kid friendly<br /><br />Cons:<br />Overpriced<br />Flavor 3 on a scale of 10<br />Crust was not chewy or crisp, biscuit like consistancy<br />Overall, I would not use this product again.  Felt it was a waste of good pizza toppings.  Will only use a traditional yeast to make my pizza crust in the future."

234414,Anonymous,1,"I've been feeding my cat this food for years without a problem. Recently she began vomiting uncontrollably after eating the food. Around her feeding time, she was at her bowl crying an begging for food like she usually does, but when we fed her she refused to touch the stuff. We thought maybe she just didn't have an appetite because she wasn't feeling well, but she scarfed down the treats and tuna we gave her. That was when we started to suspect that something was wrong with the food. We went out and bought her some canned food, and she ate that too. The only thing she wouldn't touch was the Purina food that she had eaten for years. She also stopped throwing up after we switched her food. After that, I turned to google to see if there were any recalls. I didn't find any, but I did find numerous complaints on the consumeraffairs dot com about cats (and dogs...apparently the problem isn't limited to cat food) who have recently gotten sick from Purina food. I would NOT buy this food. I have already stopped feeding it to my own cats, and I would suggest that everyone else do the same.<br /><br />If you pet has already gotten sick from the food, call this number to complain. 1-866-787-4621"

This lasagna has always turned out flawless. Well, today, Christmas Eve, I was very short on time and decided to give these a try.  What an idiot mistake on my part (first, to do on a holiday, and second, to think that there is ever a valid short-cut to give you the same results as the long route).<br /><br />I baked according to directions and was utterly disgusted to see the results.  The noodles were thin, gummy, and almost non-existent in the dish.  Sure, they ""stretched"" to the edges of the pan as they claimed, but who cares?  It's garbage!  I'm pretty confident in my abilities in the kitchen, and I don't think the mistake was on me.  Now that I think about it, I believe I tried these several years ago and had horrible results...which is why I didn't use them in this recipe in the first place.  Too bad I didn't think of that earlier when I was only concentrating on saving time.<br /><br />So, now we'll be having spaghetti and meat sauce (thank goodness I've always got a back-up).

I ordered these and other flavor (double chocolate chunk) and after eating a couple of each, noticed that one of the cookies had bluish green mold on it.  I assumed it was a bad one in the batch.  I saw on the manufacturer's website that these should be stored in the freezer since the shelf life is 90 days (due to natural ingredients and no preservatives).  I immediately put them in the freezer after getting them 3 weeks earlier.  The next 4 cookies I opened had that same mold on it and after I examine the rest, I found that they all were moldy.  Apparently Amazon had them stored in their warehouse for a while before I rec'd them.  Since there were no dates stamped on the cookies, I have no idea how long they sat in the warehouse before I got them.<br />I will not be ordering these again and will be wary of ordering other food products from Amazon.com.  They were great about refunding my money and I will continue to purchase from amazon, just not short shelf life food items."

LOVED it!<br /><br />But recently this brand (from walmart most recently) was revisited and compared.<br /><br />This used to be a top notch product but now sometthings changes and my last 3bags were tasteless crud.<br /><br />To scientifically make sure I didn't do something wrong Know that ALL equipment is the same and other brands perform normal with them. Grind coarsness, water temp, container, brew time, ect...A double dose of finer grounds presses some sorta tinted tasteless water.<br /><br />There is NO WAY they can stay in business like this. I'm sure some changes will be made.<br /><br />Cons that are true:<br />discolored lite beans<br />No amount of coffee improves anything<br />No aroma when bag first opened<br />New packaging may be flawed (air valve)<br />Seems stale<br /><br />Amazon has always appeased me but this company has some very real issues.<br /><br />Stear clear until things straighten up? I advise to always pay attention to dates on reviews. Alot of positive comments on these guys is in years past. Recent blogs are negative across the boards."

236947,Denise G. Olazar,1,"I love the taste of this coconut.  I read about the fact that they sold it as having ""1 gram"" of sugar, then eventually corrected their labels to show 18 grams of sugar.  HUGE DIFFERENCE!  I thought it was healthy-14 grams of fiber with only 4 grams of fat.  Now I SERIOUSLY question the fat content.  If 42 grams of shredded coconut has 25 grams of fat, how can 42 grams of this coconut only have 4 grams of fat?  I saw the shredded coconut at Whole Foods and read the label.  I mean that stuff seems dry, yet they claim this product only has 4 grams?  I don't believe it. Okay, add to the fact that I've been gaining weight and wasn't sure why-this is the only thing I have changed in my diet.  BUYER BEWARE-TOO MUCH SUGAR AND I CAN'T BELIEVE ONLY 4 GRAMS OF FAT.  I'm considering having it tested, that is how pissed off I am.  I thought it was a relatively healthy evening sweet."

I just found out it's name and packaging have changed and I've placed my order! In the interim, I purchased the Navitas brand and have been disappointed. There were a number of green and dried leaves in the bag, which I never experienced with the ""other"" brand. I was about two-thirds of the way through my current bag when I discovered a couple of lovely little worms floating in my tea! FYI, I usually start my morning off with a big cup of hot tea, sweetened with gojis. After seeing the additional protein in my tea I decided to check the remaining contents of the bag. I emptied it out onto a white paper towel and discovered a number of more white worms. The bag has been kept sealed and stored in a dry, cool area so I blame the product not how it was stored. I'm very disappointed and will not be purchasing any more products from this company."

253643,Mr. T,1,"Sorry to give this 1 star. but this milk really makes our baby really sick!! :(, literally!!<br />if your baby can take it, I guess it's a good one but for us, we had the worst experience with it.<br /><br />Here is our story.<br />My baby had been solely breastfed. After 9 months my wife was running short of her milk. She didn't have enough breastmilk for the baby and he didn't take as much solid food as we would want him to.<br />We gave him Similac Advance, it was recommended by the hospital. First Similac Advance Liquid, he threw up 9 times within 2 hours after half an hour of feeding. That happened twice. A few days later, we tried Similac Advance power, he threw up again! This time 5 times plus serious diarrhea for 5 days. He has lost 5% of his weight within 2 days. That's really bad.<br /><br />We were desperate. We took him to the hospital twice that week. The doctor though it was stomach flu.<br />However, I didn't quit agree with him. What a coincident that 2 different formula milk feeding incidents would throw my baby off balance. I'm a computer engineer and dealing with solving and debugging problems all the time.<br />I was firm with the doctor that this was not a coincident. I thought it might have something to do with the protein in the formula that my baby couldn't digest. We decided to try Lactose free formula (Nutramigen from Enflora). It smell and taste really awful (my wife tried it and she gagged.<br />As we thought, my baby rejected to drink it. Then I tried Good Start soy. Same story, smell bad but not as bad as Nutromigen. My baby also rejected to drink it.<br /><br />Now we were really desperate, not enough milk for him and he doesn't like to eat solid food!! He would throw up + diarrhea if he gave him normal formula milk. Phone call to 4 advise nurses, no luck! I finally search on the internet and found a lot of similar story to what we experienced (including this on Amazon reviews).<br />I decided to give it a final try, crossing our fingers really tight. Good Start Gentle Plus is our last hope or my baby would not have any more milk to drink. He's losing weight!!<br /><br />And then miracle happened!!! This milk works wonderfully for him. The only complain I would have is that it doesn't smell as good as the normal cow milk-based formula, however, doesn't smell or taste awful like the other two.<br /><br />My baby didn't quite used to the tasted in the beginning and didn't really want to drink it at first. So we tried mixed it with breastmilk for a few days.<br /><br />Now he is a happy baby, gaining weight, doesn't throw up and used to the taste of it.<br />My wife and I are now happy again :)"
223123,N. A. Duncan,1,I have been ordering these on subscribe and save for several months now.  This last shipment included a box of 12 that is bad but I can't find anywhere to report it and secure a replacement.  This is a major flaw in using subscribe and save and in ordering food items here.

148950,HappyDragon,1,"The blender functioned poorly from the very beginning of usage. After the steaming is done, the food just sit on top of the blending blade without much movement. I have to shake it or stir it before I got the appropriate consistency. After just two to three months of weekly usage, the blender died on me after creating some black smoke and a bad plastic smell. Interestingly, the steamer is still working. But why do I need a $100 mini steamer and mash things up manually afterwards? I'd not recommend this product."

For the price I paid, the food should look attractive and taste good. I don't think I would have been too disappointed had the price point been a little lower. The pictures on the boxes look 10x better than the actual food itself. I will not purchase from them again. And, I was so excited! Maybe my expectations were too high?"

I have yet to get a 'good' pot out of this. To be fair, what I expected from this was good flavor and strength. The coffee is weak, in my opinion. I also feel it lacks appealing flavor or flavor at all in some cases. I feel the taste is equal to making coffee from a bargain brand, which this is not. I would not re-order or recommend this coffee. Note that I love, however, the decaf version of this, which is very good- tasty and robust."

269161,G. Byron,1,"This was the biggest waste of our money.  I don't know what the solution is, but this trap is not it.  The so called ""spikes"" are not sharp enough to even penetrate my hand when triggered, much less something as small as a mole. When you pull the trap up, you don't know if you got the mole, because, unless you plan on digging up your yard to see if the mole might be there, you don't know.  We emailed the moleman, and he said that we needed to stick a piece of wood under the trap so that when the ""spikes"" come down, they do not just trap the mole.  So the past 6 times this trap has gone off, we have caught the mole, only to pull the trap out and set him free.  No where on the box or in the directions does it state the detail that needs to be taken.  I say, either live with em, or hire a professional.  Or, MOVE!!!!!!!!!!!"

567137,Orlando,1,"I want to return my recent purchase of Olivado Avocado oil. The oil is not at all like the seller/manufacturer had described it to be. Doesn't smell or tastes like Hass avocados. Hardly. Tastes more like cooked leafy greens. I am beginning to believe that buying avocado oil online is probably not the best way to go. This is the second brand of avocado oil (also tried San Pietro Chilean Organic avocado oil) I've purchased and both have been horrible. Maybe manufacturers of these oils should be more honest in describing the tastes of these oils so that the consumer would know what to expect. If they say it should taste mild and buttery than that's what one expects. Not citrus-like or herbaceous like described by others consumers. Also, I've read that avocado oil can go rancid despite the date on the bottle. That if it smells and tastes odd then probably it's rancid or on its way there. I've come across lots of oils in my lifetime and never the tought of it being rancid has ever entered my mind. Probably because I've never really come across any until now. Maybe avocado oil is a far to delicate of an oil that needs to be stored and handled in a special manner which too many sellers don't know how to. Anyway, I think I would give some other oil a try.<br /><br />Note: This is a follow up to my review. I wouldn't do business with this company ever again. Besides selling me a bad product, they make me responsible for shipping costs. So that means that instead of the $21.97 reimbursement,  I will only be credited $11.99 and they would not do so unless I ship them back the product which I had to pay $5.  to get it back to them.

I used pork Char Siu in with it, and that was fine, as I said, I am a big fan of NOHs Char Siu, but this stuff was about useless.<br /><br />I added extra Teriyaki sauce, just to give the rice some flavor, and it actually got better tasting the 2nd day.

373707,Meghan,1,"I used my Beaba for the first time this week to make my 6 month old's food. There were some annoyance issues with its functionality (no beeping or alert to let you know when steaming is finished, smaller capacity which meant that one large sweet potato needed to be split into two steaming batches, and the fact that you have to hold the dial continuously during the puree stage or it turns off).<br /><br />While I could probably live with those factors, I became concerned when I read reviews from other parents regarding mold and other materials in the reservoir. I got out a flashlight and decided to look at the reservoir. Although I had followed the instructions to run the machine through three steam cycles before you begin using it, the reservoir contained brown liquid spots in the bottom. I used a paper towel to try and get out the spots. The liquid was some sort of chemical lubricant.<br /><br />If you wish to use this product, please make sure that you check the reservoir with a flashlight before and after each use. It seems pointless to go through the effort of making organic food for your child when the food ends up contaminated with mold or chemicals due to the Beaba's design."

This time, the origin is not mentioned on the bag, and when I checked their website, I see they've written a bunch of malarky about how porcinis'taste the same wherever they're from, even from North America or China. That is just not true. Porcini from Europe taste better: the terroir changes the mushroom's flavor considerably, just as it changes the flavor of grapes made into wine. Since JR Mushrooms refuses to reveal their country of origin, I must assume they are selling cheaper, possibly contaminated mushrooms from China in order to make a bigger profit. Beware!

I don't know if it's the artificial coloring, flavors, oatmeal and traces of wheat, BHT or WHAT. It's just a bad combo.

There is also a very strong flavor of cinnamon. I usually add some cinnamon to the food she eats so I know that she likes cinnamon if its in a normal quantity. I tried diluting the flavor in several ways, but it's no use. The cinnamon flavor was still too strong. I still have about 8 more jars to experiment with.

262184,Disappointed,1,"A blogger friend of mine tried out PB Crave and posted rave reviews. Being a huge peanut butter fan myself I decided to order this for an upcoming camping trip. My order was placed on July 17th with a delivery window of July 23 - 26th. Perfect, it would arrive a week before we leave on our trip. July 26th came and past with no order or shipment history with FedEx, the only history FedEx had was that a label was created but the package never shipped.<br /><br />I email PB Crave on Sunday July 29th inquiring about my shipment and got a response on Monday. Apparently one of the flavors in my trio was out of stock but they graciously offered to ship my order sometime next week and would throw in the CoCo Banana for my troubles OR I could cancel my order all together and they would issue a refund. My issue is the lack of communication, had they emailed me when I placed my order notifying me of the back order I would have opted to substitute my original order with something else.  This wasn't even an option. I replied to their gracious offer asking them to substitute and overnight the new order to me (so far no response), I will update IF they respond to my reply.<br /><br />Is this going to ruin our camping trip, no..But there is a slight disappointment. This was going to be something new for the huge group of kids going on our family trip to try out and a couple of those kids are huge peanut butter enthusiasts and were just as excited as I was about trying something new."

So next I tried putting a tiny amount on my hands and then smoothing it through the ends of my hair.  This was a little better, but my hair still felt greasy.

527080,Kim in Mpls,1,"As some of the other reviewers have noted, Baby's Only Organic Formula contains high levels of arsenic. I would love to have exclusively breastfed, but, due to a low milk supply that couldn't meet my baby's needs, I have to supplement with formula. I did a ton of research before buying Baby's Only and thought I was giving my baby the next best thing to breastmilk. I didn't want to buy Earth's Best because it contains hexane. Baby's Only was the only organic formula I could find without hexane. So I was appalled when I learned that Baby's Only dairy formula tested for high levels of arsenic (read the story on the Boston Globe's website: ""Arsenic hidden in baby formula, cereal bars, and energy shots?"") due to the brown rice syrup in it. Baby's Only hasn't issued a recall, voluntary or otherwise. I cannot believe this formula is still being sold. DO NOT BUY BABY'S ONLY. I ended up ordering another organic formula called Holle from a website in Germany. It's not available in the US, but the international shipping cost was worth it for my baby's health."

The truffettes have 5 mg of cholestrol while the Donckels have none.  The Donckels have a very light texture and melt in your mouth while the Truffettes are heavy more like a fudge than a truffle.

The products are not even close inflavor or texture.

I thought I would like them because I like regular Twizzlers and I also like sour gummy candy, but these have none of the good qualities of either.<br /><br />As soon as I opened the package I smelled a weird, Play-Doh like smell. The twizzlers were extremely soft, rubbery and plastic-like, and they tasted terrible. They weren't really sweet or sour. One was supposed to be lemon and the other cherry, but the closest to either flavor that I tasted was a vague cough-syrup type flavor from the red vine. The gooey stuff in the middle wasn't really gooey, either, it was just softer than the outside. I'm really surprised that this product was released because Twizzlers are so great, how could they mess it up in such a big way?<br /><br />It comes in a huge bag and I threw the rest of it out after one taste.

When I asked where they got the substance, they said from China. This had me worried. I was not sure where the rest of their products came from, but they did confirm some of them do come from China.  I was concerned about product contamination, not knowing why the product smelled as it did.<br /><br />I ordered a great variety of items including the candies from them.  But when I called to voice my concerns about some of the products, they were very rude and negative on the phone and even hung up on me at one point. I would not order from them again, especially since NOW foods has a better product and wonderful customer service.<br /><br />(Note:  their xylitol apparently comes from the US.

The Emerald brand nuts are sweetened with sucralose and have a funny fake sweetener taste that is unpleasant.  The Blue Diamond Almonds are sweetened with Stevia so they taste more natural and also have a richer chocolate flavor. I would not recommend the Emerald brand of this product.

135929,Cas,1,"This is the newest aloe-based tea entry from Chantea. It's a ""health drink"" that touts its green tea component prominently on its label, which wisely is a wraparound given that its inclusion of tons of little pulpy bits is going to put many drinkers off. Except for orange juice and the like, most people don't have a lot of experience with non-smooth clear drinks--this looks and feels in the mouth a lot more like bubble tea or mega-pulpy orange juice.<br /><br />The taste: oddly medicinal, with the passionfruit carrying the tone of the drink and a strange astringent aftertaste that lingers way too long on the tongue. I didn't taste much green tea in this, but that's not a huge shock given that the first two ingredients on the label are water and sugar. The main flavors are ""sweet"" and ""strange fruity sensation."" Indeed, this tiny little 11.5oz container is apparently considered 1.5 servings (another thing that will put off American drinkers at least, who are accustomed to consuming a bottled drink at one go and certainly won't pour out only 2/3 of the drink and save the rest for later), which makes it possible for the manufacturer to put its carb count at 20g rather than the 30g it probably should get--which makes it pretty much an uncarbonated soda. I'm very put off by the fast-and-loose game played with the nutritional label.<br /><br />The texture was also unpalatable. I'm no stranger to pulpy bits in my drinks, but these were as numerous as they were undefinable. Were they aloe bits (doubtful but possible, but they looked precisely like an orange's pulp)? Were they passionfruit (way more likely but passionfruit pulp is not in the ingredient list)? The ingredient list gave no indication whatsoever what I was tasting.<br /><br />I think this drink would appeal way more to consumers who are used to pulpy drinks like bubble tea and who don't mind drinking that much sugar water--and who are way way into passionfruit. For me, as much as I'd looked forward to trying it, I couldn't finish the bottle."

I will add that the butter flavor does not taste like butter and has a very slight chemical aftertaste.

88697,Speedy,1,I'm an avid gum chewing person who has been trying to switch over to natural sugar free gum.  Initially I purchased this product due to the price being cheaper than it's main competitor spry.  What a mistake that was.  Actually this product is no cheaper after you spend 4.99 on shipping and also count in the additional time you have to wait for the product (4 -5 days) to be delivered.  The product tastes great initially but after about 5 minutes of chewing it tastes like crap. It leaves a very nasty after taste in your mouth. I'm forcing myself to chew it so I don't feel like I've wasted my money but it's not worth it.  The Spry gum tastes soooooo much better and it lasts.  Also I've tasted the variety of Spry flavors and they are all good.  So my final recommendation is to save your money on this product if taste matters. If it doesn't matter and cleaning you teeth is the key issue then go right ahead and torture yourself.
87289,"MJA ""Curious Mind""",1,"I own a bread machine and use honey for my whole wheat loaves.  This product works great for a few weeks, but then something happens to the honey.  It gets thicker.  (And this was in bottles that were sealed and unopened).  This resulted in my bread not mixing properly.  The dough would get clumpy and would not blend together properly.  I had to throw out half of the honey."

My 11 month old daughter took one bite and literally spit it out.  I tasted it and it was so lacking flavor.  I'll be making this combination for her on my own in our Beaba BabyCook.  The other fruit and veggie combinations are great, but this offering missed the mark completely."

Perhaps Rachael doesn't know what a high quality ingredient is.<br /><br />Nutrish is full of fillers and allergens, though it says No Fillers on the packaging.

441414,JB15606,1,"I just bought the Yummy Earth Vitamin C pops 30 oz container as both Halloween candy and for myself to enjoy. The item flavor description is different than the flavors I received. So, just be aware that this might be the case before you buy.<br /><br />I find it completely ridiculous to just notice that someone negatively reviewed this problem 11 MONTHS ago, and they STILL have not corrected the problem! Get on the ball, Amazon and Yummy Earth!<br /><br />It states that the lollis are currently, ""Razzmatazz Berry, Tooberry Blueberry, Strawberry Smash"", AND then a, ""Mix of sour apple tart, pomegranate pucker, mango tango, tooberry blueberry, googly grape, strawberry smash, very very cherry, wet-face watermelon."" ??? This is both confusing and inaccurate. I didn't even notice the ""Razzmatazz Berry, Tooberry Blueberry, Strawberry Smash"" part when I ordered them, I just assumed it would be the latter, old assorted mix I've been ordering for the last 2 years. In any case, neither flavor description ended up being correct. What I actually received was just 3 flavors: ""Tooberry Blueberry, Razzmatazz Berry and Very Cherry"". I don't like any of those flavors, so it was definitely disappointing.<br /><br />You can't return grocery items, which is another hassle, but I called customer service and they were nice about sending me a completely new container for free supposedly containing the original variety assortment. Still, it seems like bad business and an unnecessary hassle; just get the description right -- so we know up front what we will be actually buying! If they have to replace enough inaccurate orders and lose money on them, maybe that'll be the final catalyst they need to change! So, hey! Extra free Halloween candy! Order away! I'll take this down when they accurately, finally update their description..."

I took one bite from a packet and forced myself to chew the styrofoamy like texture and rotten off-fish smell.  Later that day I tried to see if my dogs would eat them and got nauseous opening a packet for them.  No, they were smarter than me and just sniffed them and walked away.  This product may be wonderful for your health but I hope there is a tasteless pill that can do the same thing if we have to get health from this.

81143,M. Matthews,1,"This used to be my favorite cereal. It had fiber, good taste and texture but in the past year or two they started making it sweeter and sweeter. I don't like sweetened cereal. At least with an unsweetened cereal I can choose to make it sweeter myself. But if it is too sweet out of the box there is no choice to make it less sweet. I contacted the company and told them I didn't like how sweet they had made it now. They denied that they had changed anything. They lost me as a customer after that. I was buying 6 boxes a month for almost 2 years straight. I stopped. I waited a few months and decided to try again to see if they had changed their recipe back the way it used to be. I just opened a new box and it is still sickening sweet for my tastes. Goodbye Nature's Path. If I wanted super sweetened sugar cereal that is what I would have bought! Anybody want free 6 boxes? You can have it!!! Yuck!"

I'm EXTREMELY angry that I did not get what I ordered. If they were going to make a substition, they should have asked. If automatic substitions are their policy, they should state that in the description. If the description is wrong, THEY SHOULD FIX IT.

This was my first experience receiving old nuts which were far below the standard I have come to expect.  Instead of a nice white they were brown.  They were not as flavorfull as in the past and I suspect they were just starting to go bad.  The flavoring was clumped instead of being evenly distributed on the nut.  They left a bad taste in my mouth.  I thought I would get a box of six as I have received in the past, but instead, I received six individual cans which were repackaged in plastic.  There were no expiration dates since they were repackaged.  It makes me wonder if they were repackaged because they had expired.  I'm truly disappointed."

209830,Salinwa,1,"I finally decided to order a package deal knowing I could get stuffed sole (scallops and crabmeat) with steaks as well as various other things. Tried the steaks first and while I was disappointed with the size I do say they are way more properly portioned than what I usually get. They are quite thin and are okay at best but definitely not worth the money. Next we tried the potatoes au gratin and I liked that they were different than the sliced stuff in a casserole dish I remember having as a kid (never liked them before) but these were potato balls and while they looked really good they fell short of what I was expecting and my expectations were not that high. One of those deals where the first bite is pretty good and it just goes down hill from there ~ by the time I was done with the first one I didn't care to eat the second one. They seemed like processed frozen food rather than a gourmet type item. I had just always thought ""Ohama Steaks"" and figured for the price everything would be that of a high-end steakhouse in quality but it isn't even in the ball park of a high-end steakhouse.<br /><br />So... what has prompted me to finally write (I wasn't going to) was tonight I tried the stuffed sole. I had one a while back ""just to see"" and while it seemed really bland it was so-so, so I thought I'd prepare a side dish (my own mashed potatoes) with it this time and give it another shot. (I'm a nut for anything crab and scallop.) Being hungry I baked 2 of them. Again I was disappointed with how bland it was but when I started finding BONES in my mouth that was it. BOTH of them had little bones.<br /><br />It was obviously a waste of time and money and I don't even care about the rest of the food. I may try to see if I can give it away. I am simply not interested and having paid that much money for this stuff and it tasting like some cheap clearance item, not to mention the BONES!! That is just not acceptable to me. I'm glad it wasn't one of my kids eating it."

42202,Rick Maczko,1,"I was in a hurry as I shopped at my local pet food store late on a Saturday night.  My dogs needed dog food.  I buy a high quality dog food, it's ingredients contain everything my vet wants me to be feeding me dogs. I also wanted to get them some special treats. But in my haste I picked up a bag of these ""gourmet"" chicken breast treats.  Usually I read the label on everything I give my dogs.  Not this time, they looked healthy and were very similar to other chicken breast treats I normally buy.  Had I carefully read the back of the bag I would have immediately returned them to the shelf and moved on.  The words on the back of the bag ""not for human consumption, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling this product""-""made in China"" would have tipped me off!!!  I never saw these warnings until after my beloved jack russell became very ill only mere hours after eating one of these treats.  My vet wanted to know what had she eaten that was different?  I handed him the bag-he looked it over in horror.  My dog developed an obstruction from the treat, which caused bloat because nothing could pass, salmonella and e-coli poisoning, and an infection in her heart giving her a 4/6 heart murmur.  She had to undergo expoloratory surgery, 7 sets of xrays, 2 ultrasounds, multiple blood tests,an ecg and we're not done yet.  She is still in recovery, tests still pending.  This was one of the healthiest dogs my vet cared for before this incident.  Never had a health issue in the past, never a heart murmur.  At 9 years old most people thought she was 3 or 4.  I have been told the heart murmur has been caused by the infection settling in her heart, which is now irreversable.  Which means if she makes it through all of this her life expectancy just went from 16+ to 10 or 11.<br />My vet cultured one of the treats and could not believe what disease and bacteria it was loaded with.  I cannot believe I took such good care of her for 9 years and then put her through all of this suffering because I didn't take the time to carefully look the product over. Thank you, Cadet and IMS Pet Products for contributing to my dog's pain and suffering."

Save your money. It tastes like it was made by a chemist, not someone who has ever tasted real - or even good instant - cocoa."

I cannot determine the true source of their oil, but each of the three bottles I purchased had a very acidic bite to it: either the oil was rancid or simply of very poor quality. Good oil will have a smooth buttery quality to it --- you can sip olive oil with the same delicateness of palate as you would wine. This oil however completely fails this test."

I sent a message to the Nature's Path people concerning the contamination and have yet to hear back. Being that this product is a ""natural"" product, there should be NO POSSIBILITY FOR CHEMICAL contamination in the processing of this product. This is perhaps the first time in my life that I have ever returned a product for any type of contamination. I believe it says volumes about the essential BS that natural products are perceived as safer than regular products."

I like the other V8 Fusion canned flavors such as Strawberry Banana, Pomegranate Blueberry, and Concord Grape Raspberry very much, and drink them consistently, but this is just abysmal. It's hard to describe the taste though, it's sweet, yet it still makes me want to gag. You can taste the peach mango too. I think that the taste factor might have more to do with the fact that this is 50% juice and 50 calories, while the other flavors are 100% juice and about 120 calories. This diet/energy version is like a watered down nasty version of the original."

The only bad review wasn't based on taste, so I felt secure in ordering them. My bad.<br /><br />Cotton candy is one of my favorite flavors, too. I adore it. I like cotton candy-flavored anything. Jelly beans, gum, Slurpees, you name it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these taste nothing like cotton candy to me, not even remotelyk like it. They don't even taste like plain sugar. They aren't very sweet. There is pretty much no taste to them at all, except a faint chemical/cardboard flavor. These are the most vile-tasting lollipops I've ever tried. I barely got through the one I tried.<br /><br />I have a fairly acute palate and I cannot describe the flavor of these lollipops, but it's most definitely not cotton candy, not even close.  They're not even good enough to give away, in my opinion. They're THAT bad.<br /><br />If you have not tried these before, do not buy them without trying them first.<br /><br />I think that this is an item that you had to have grown up eating in order to like. It must be one of those guilty pleasure foods. I have them, we all do.<br /><br />Also, about 20% of them were badly broken. I know I could contact Amazon and ask for a refund, but I feel that this is mostly my fault this time for not having done due diligence before the purchase. Amazon is not at fault because the product tastes lousy."

109104,Heidi,1,"I have to say I'm incredibly disappointed with this seed kit.  First, neither cilantro pod even sprouted.  I went to the Aerogarden website and got replacement pods, but they don't offer a replacement for cilantro, so my garden is not likely to be very ""South of the Border"".  In addition, the only two pods that are really growing are the globe basil and epozate.  The thyme, parsley and oregano are a pathetic bunch of sprouts that are beginning to turn brown after four weeks.  I'm following the directions and just finished a successful garden, so it's not like I'm doing anything wrong.  These gardens are supposed to be idiot-proof, at any rate.  I would not bother purchasing this seed kit in the future."
115499,KatieZ,1,"First let me say that the product itself is excellent and I have no problems with it. This review is mainly about Amazon's idea of proper packaging. I ordered this with super saver shipping and it will be the last time. from now on I will order from another vendor and pay for shipping.<br /><br />When I received the package it was stained and 3 cans had been so severely damaged that they were leaking, 2 others were questionable and 7 others were severely dented but safe to use( I work in a canning facility so I know how to test vacuum in cans). The product was packaged with no padding at all in a box that was a good deal larger than the item. I saved no money at all on free shipping as I had to discard 5 cans of an already expensive cat food."
435261,Eureeka,1,"I'm not an organic person, so i don't normally order organic items. With that in mind, take this review with a grain of salt, as I'm comparing them to normal regular foods.<br /><br />The recipe on the side of the can calls for 2 cups of mix. the can itself is 2 and 2/3 cups in size. What pray tell are you supposed to do with that extra 2/3 cup of mix is beyond me, but i guess that since your getting a 4 pack, they expect you to combine them and make an extra batch.<br /><br />The cakes cook up nice and fluffy: if you use an egg instead of oil (recipe says you can sub one for the other). The one thing i can't seem to get my head around, or fix is that they always seem gritty. I blend them, I wisk them, I puree the batter but the grit is always there.<br /><br />Not nearly the worst part is the metallic after taste, if I wanted to put something in my mouth that tasted like a penny... I would be using a penny. It may be smaller, but is far less work, frustration, and money.<br /><br />on that note... stay away from this unless you MUST have organic pancake mix. I for one, do not need it and will not buy again."

Its super super sweet and the main grain puff (its a square light brown puff) that has the consistency of a hard Cheeto (the cheese snack).

74413,Jane Twain,1,"Either these folks are completely ignorant or they think putting "" no genetically engineered ingredients"" on the front of the package will cause us to to ignore their list of ingredients on the back.  Canola oil is made from genetically modified rapeseed. They also say it may have Safflower or Sunflower oil, but I'd<br />rather not take part in that lottery. I'd like to send back this lot, but I'm not willing to bet, they would not have the nerve to sell it to the next unsuspecting soul, so it will go straight into the trash can ,where it belongs."

322339,D. J. Bradley,1,Stevia based sweeteners have now proliferated like dandelions. This product was available locally and was on sale so I tried it.<br /><br />Their quality control is abysmal. At times it takes one package to sweeten tea or hot cereal. Then there are other times when it takes three packets to achieve the same sweetness. Same beverage and same hot cereal but some packets just don't have the same amount of the Stevia extract in them.<br /><br />A second problem is that this product tends to clump. It will dissolve OK but the clumping is quite noticable. I would recommend that you look at the reviews and then select some other Stevia based sweetener. I WOULD NOT buy this product again.

I really wanted to like it and had high hopes for the product.<br /><br />For those who may find it helpful here are the ingredients for each.

It has changed from 2g of sugar to 7g of sugar without even improving the taste, unless you prefer to eat sugar for breakfast; I do not. Guess I'll have to scour the local stores for the old recipe version and eventually find a new breakfast option. Big letdown Kellogg's."

Capsules were poorly assembled; most were cracked or split, leaving a large portion of product loose in the bottle, as was the case in all 6 bottles. Further inspection revealed brittle, poor-quality capsules which seemed to be assembled in haste (read: off balance and/or incomplete assembly) thus causing splits & breakage. Since ""consistency"" is the focus for this product, I would NOT recommend this brand."

Even neighbours wondered and asked what was this smell. There was No Customer Service or Help for me to contact. I left few pieces outside and even the Squirrel and Skunk did not like it.

9505,TomA,1,"If this was called ""Medium Roast"", I would give it 4 stars. It's a good coffee.<br /><br />But this is called French Vanilla Caramel, and this review is based on the product's name.<br /><br />Let me say that vanilla and caramel are perhaps my favorite flavors... coffee, ice cream, candy, you name it... if it's vanilla or caramel, I love it.<br /><br />With the exception of this.<br /><br />Where's the vanilla? Where's the caramel? And don't get me wrong: I'm not trying to say that the flavors are too mild. I'm saying that they are NON-EXISTENT. And therefore, based on the name, this coffee gets 1 star."

I have had many different variants of Kona, ranging from pure to similarly labeled blends - none of which were so bad.  This is dry, bitter and bland - probably the worst of all worlds.<br /><br />To put things into perspective, Costa Rican from the same vendor is an infinitely superior coffee that I have as a subscription mainstay for my house.<br /><br />Again, I like this vendor, but despise this particular coffee.  Don't waste your money . . . After Eight from your local grocer would be 100 times better."
172140,Middletown Lawyer,1,"Nothing has changed since the past purchasers posted their reviews. Instead of the blue Equal packets shown in the picture, we received Sweetmate. Apparently it is the same as Equal, and if it was for my own use, I wouldn't be too upset. However, I purchased this for an office, and it's caused a bit of an uproar, as everyone thinks we have switched to an inferior sweetener - it's tough to convince the angry coffee drinkers otherwise! I realize now that the title says Sweetmate. But as it also says Equal, and shows pictures of Equal packets, I don't think it's unreasonable to be surprised when a different product arrives."

I read every single prints on the bag.  There is no mention of its being organic, which is important to me since being organic = non-GMO.  All Arrowhead Mills puffed products are advertised as ""ORGANIC"" but only the Kamut cereal has the organic seal.  I'm switching to kamut cereal.  I gave it 1 star to get other buyers' attention."

3665,"Debra A. Buell ""adirondakdeb""",1,"This product comes from a very good company that makes a number of excellent Gluten free as well as non-gluten free baking products. DO NOT let the poor quality of this one product keep you from trying other products they make. This mix is a classic example of a very poorly designed and likely untested Gluten free product. It lacks enough sugar and moisture ingredients to make the finished product taste good and mix well. As with many Gluten Free products new to the market, you find yourself constantly adding ""something"" to try to make it right. To these, I had to add nearly a full cup of sugar to begin to dissipate the very bitter taste. I added both applesauce and plain yogurt during different baking sessions to get a consistency that would feel and move like a muffin mix. THIS mix takes too much ""Doctoring"" to be recommended at all until Hodgson Mill goes back to the drawing board and fixes this. BUT, Hodgson Mill does have other good products. Try their Blueberry Muffin Mix and hope that one day Amazon will carry a wider array of their Gluten Free offerings as many are very, very good."

382142,Chuck,1,"Oh, my, how awful this was. Beth Hilson should be spinning in Bette Hagman's grave.<br />I am a highly experienced baker. I'm not new to GF baking, but I am new to GF pie crust (I've avoided it and pie for years).<br />The package is too small, especially for the money. The product as packaged should be increased at least 25% by weight. As it is, it barely makes the prescribed-size 8"" pies. And good luck finding an 8"" pie pan in a retail store (Amazon has them). There is no reason Gluten Free Pantry cannot market products that are sized to fit standard-sized U.S. pans (9"" or 10""). This is just cheapness on their part.<br />The instructions should be written so as to be as foolproof as possible. Making a GF crust is not the same thing as regular pie crust. It will not look or feel the same. For instance, when cutting in the 2nd 10 oz of shortening, the flour turned to a solid, waxy mass, nothing like regular pie crust. This was before any liquid was added. All ingredients were chilled. This made it difficult to mix in the liquid ingredients. No guided descriptions or instructions are offered.<br />Moreover, the instructions say ""3 tsp vinegar,"" ""2 Tbsp water"" and 2 eggs. 3 tsp is a tablespoon. Eggs vary in size, and instructions should be given regarding the total amount of eggs and water so as to be exact. My eggs were extra large, so I reduced the amount of water. Nevertheless, the dough was still far too wet, so I held off on adding all the eggs + water + vinegar. You could add some AP GF flour or starch if things get too wet.<br />Even after 90 minutes of chilling, the dough was very soft. It did roll out between sheets of plastic wrap, and transferred to the pan with some tearing that was easy to patch. However, I found this a tedious and moderately difficult task, and I am a very experienced cook and baker. There was almost no extra crust - maybe 2 oz, or a ball the size of a walnut - left over. I had to struggle to roll the crust in the exact size and shape to fit my pan.<br />My unattractive result looks nothing like the crust on the box, neither in thickness, nor in texture. It is too thin on the pie, and it collapsed unattractively and did not set in the oven. Also, the crust browned on the edges of my tin pie pans too quickly (because the edges are too thin because there isn't enough crust), with only 30 mins of baking at 350 deg. Usually vinegar retards browning in crust. Even covered with foil, the edges burned and won't be eaten.<br />A subsequent insult is that somehow the top crust on my berry pie partially dissolved into the filling before it set in the oven. Then I poked the top crust with my finger and it has turned into this loose, sandy mass - ghastly.<br />I will update after I taste it."

We weren't 100% sure after we found the first one dead, but the second one was obvious.<br /><br />The company's website claims that none of their chargers will harm *any* animal so we called them up and let them know they kill. As it turns out, they already knew that their continuous chargers kill small animals so they sent us an intermittent one for free. (Doesn't really make up for the $400 worth of animals their product has killed and the fact that one was a pet.) They haven't changed their website even though it's a lie. I noticed that they also sell chargers specifically for birds that are continuous and run at the same power output as the chargers for larger animals. One has to wonder why they sell a product that they know will kill the very animals it's supposed to be protecting. Avoid this company."

But what if you do like us, and always dump the food into an airtight container to keep vermin out? Presto-Chango! NO UPC CODE. And What do you do if you also Mix your food with another (higher end) brand? There's 60 bucks worth of dog food there that we now have to throw out. Fantastic. What do you do? Well you contact Diamond Naturals, tell them exactly that, and they respond, by saying ""If you don't have the Bag, when in doubt, throw the food out. Since we value you as a customer, we're going to give a coupon for more Diamond Naturals, Just cut the UPC code off the Bag and send it to us."" ....Really? Hellooooo? Testing...is this thing on? So you email them back, pointing out again, that it's not possible to send them something you don't have, and again asking... ""Hey, what about the other food that's ruined too? I have the record of buying them both on the same day from Amazon.""  What happens next? Apparently Nothing, No Response, Zip.

When my order arrived, I noted that there was no indication on the labeling that the product was organic.  Also, the ingredient was listed on the label as ""black truffle aroma"".  Black truffle aroma is a manufactured product, not natural, and is chemically induced by bubbling chemical gases in the oil.  There are no truffles used in manufacture.  I am not an expert on what is ""organic"", but bubbling chemicals into an oil to induce an artificial flavor does not seem ""organic"" to me.  Buyer beware!"
27717,JonMartinMN,1,"After several failed attempts at making yogurt, I discovered the small slip of paper included. It states, to paraphrase, that the unit will only hold the correct temperature for making the yogurt if the room temperature is between 68(F) and 72(F). If the room temperature is higher.. ""It is important in summer to use the yogurt maker in an air conditioned room...."". I can't imagine turning on the A/C to cool the house down to 72(F) JUST to make yogurt! When I DO turn it on, I set it for 80. In the winter, the kitchen is usually 65, so I imagine that would keep the temperature too low for proper incubation.<br /><br />Unless your kitchen is always around 70 degrees, I'd say pass on this unit.<br />I'll be listing it on the local FreeCycle board to get rid of it."

I wasn't sure what the first picture they showed was, but all the others were pictures of the kind of cute little bunny I wanted for my girls.  Maybe the first one was a rabbit just after it was born or something.  Seeing that the price was fairly reasonable, I ordered one.  I wasn't quite sure how they were going to get a live rabbit to me through the mail, but I figured ""hey, if anyone can do it, Amazon.com can"".<br /><br />When the package got to my house, I started to get a slight feeling that something wasn't right.  The box they had sent had no air-holes, and it was strangely cold to the touch.  But I figured that I didn't know anything about rabbits, so maybe that was normal.  Deciding to press on, I wrapped up the box and placed it under the Easter-tree in our living room (actually, it's just our old Christmas tree that I was too lazy to take out to the end of the driveway, but I won't tell if you don't).<br /><br />On Easter morning, my girls were up early, wanting to open their Easter present.  I sat on the couch, with my arm around my wife as they tore the paper off the package.  Eagerly awaiting their cries of happiness, I was startled when instead I heard screams of fear and horror.  The youngest was screaming that someone killed the Easter bunny, and the oldest barely made it to the bathroom in time to vomit.  As I looked in the box, expecting to see that maybe the poor rabbit had accidentally died, I saw instead, a rabbit carcass, gutted and skinned.<br /><br />Thinking that someone had played a horrible joke on our family, I immediately called Amazon.com to explain what had happened.  When I finally got done explaining our situation, the lady on the phone told me that the rabbits were supposed to be dead, they were meat rabbits, for eating.<br /><br />This is perhaps something that should be explicitly written in the description of the product on Amazon's website.  My daughters were incredibly traumatized by the situation, and are now undergoing counseling (at a rate of $200/hour) to help them deal with what they saw.  I shudder to think of what Easter will be like next year.<br /><br />So in short, it needs to be said in the product description that these rabbits are DEAD, and they are for eating.  Don't make the same mistake I did."
136428,Wes Hood,1,"While the flavor of this coffee is acceptable, mechanically it just does not work in the Keurig brewer.  I don't know if the problem is the size of the grind or some problem with the K-cup containers themselves, but almost every cup I have tried to make has been virtually unuseable.<br /><br />The water barely drips from the K-cup while brewing instead of producing a steady stream as other containers do. On at least two occasions the back-pressure was so high as to cause my brewer to overflow out of the top of the K-cup container because the brew could not be pushed through the K-cup as it should be.  Both holes were punched in the K-cup correctly and the holes in the needles are NOT obstructed.  I can remove the Brooklyn K-cup and insert any other one I have and it will flow correctly.  I have two brewers and the problem is the same in both brewers.<br /><br />In addition to the over-flow and back-pressure problems, every cup I have brewed has also contained a significant portion of coffee grounds in the cup, several cups have been so full of grounds as to be undrinkable.  This leads me to believe that at least part of the problem is the size of the grind.<br /><br />I've used almost half the box trying to get things to work to no avail, but I don't feel I can request a refund after using that much of the product.  I have no interest in replacement product as the flavor is not that special and I don't trust it to work any better.<br /><br />I cannot in good conscience recommend this coffee to anyone."

129423,M. Lincoln,1,"When this product arrived, I noticed that it said on the label that it is ""PACKED BY"" Honeytreehoney, but there is no information as to where it is produced. I emailed Honeytreehoney, asking them to supply that information but got no response. If you care where your food comes from (US, China, Etc.),you may not want to buy this. I won't reorder it. And I'm not sure I'll use it, either.<br /><br />The one star rating is simply an indication of my dissatisfaction for the information gap, not the taste/quality of the molasses."

82145,citizen fact checker,1,"I used organic whole milk** to try to grow the grains from the scant teaspoon I received from the seller. The milk didn't develop a sourish smell, so I guess it stayed fresh, even after 30 days, but I had few and very small--size of uncooked rice--grains. I will stay with the packaged Kefir Starter that I've used for years and which I purchase from Amazon.com.<br /><br />Though I received a couple of pages of instructions from the seller, whose product is shown here at Amazon, those instructions didn't really help me, a novice at growing my own grains. I haven't bothered to contact the seller for help and/or more grains, because it seems a waste of time. I would guess from reading his enclosed instructions that while he tried to be helpful he doesn't really know how to instruct a novice in using the small amount of grains he sent.<br /><br />I am guessing that the pics showing huge grains on websites could just be marketing examples wherein the grower has been using raw milk or something like it. That's just a guess on my part, and if that is the case, it is an example of good marketing, but the sites need to give more-helpful information to the novice.<br /><br />**Perhaps that was my problem? At any rate, I love, love, love kefir as do my kittykats."

270170,Jonathon Smith,1,"I really like the flavor of this coffee.  In fact it is one of my favorite varieties for the Keurig brewer.  It really is bold without being bitter.  Unfortunately, the quality of the K-Cups that this coffee arrived in are unacceptable. Having brewed about 30 cups of this coffee, we have had 9 cups that backed up and overflowed.  About half way through the brewing process, the flow of coffee out the bottom slows down, then stops, then the coffee starts ""erupting"" out the sides of the K-cup holder.  This machine is located in an office and is used by many people with many different brands/varieties of K-cups.  This is the only kind of K-cup that clogs like this. I really love the flavor, but the lack of quality with regard to the K-cup is unacceptable."
526249,Mary Wrobel,1,"I was disappointed. The product in my opinion and numerous friends and family that tasted it, found it far from atomic. Perhaps if it had been rated on a scale of 1-10 (1 being mild and 10 being hottest)it would help the consumer determine if they want to purchase this horseradish. My opinion and that of my tasters have given this horseradish a 4 in degree of heat.(not a 10 which would make it atomic) So as not to make it a total waste of money,I spent $1.88 and purchased horseradish root from the grocery store. I grated and added it to the product.It is now suitable for our taste. Unfortunately, the people that we bought our horseradish from in the past have retired.

The taste of the broth, though, was just down-right disgusting. To me, it just tasted like spoiled fish. One bite and it was in the trash.

149019,Hiten N. Dalal,1,"Update - Feb 27, 2012<br />The product worked fine for about 6 weeks.  In the last two weeks we have had issues where the device wouldn't steam intermittently.  Everything was done exactly the same way.  No user error.  Then finally last week it seems the bearings (I think they have bearing) in the center colum broke.  The underside of the Baby brezza is dark - presumably from the grease in the bearings.  The device would steam, but the blade would not spin.<br />Then today, it stopped steaming as well.  About to send the product back.  Had nothing but problems with this since we got it.  $100 just wasted.  Wouldn't recommend it.  Extrememly frustrating when at the last minute you have to figure out some other way to feed your kid.  Products like this need to work, and work well.  They are after all for children and will be used everyday!  Not sure what kind of quality control this company has.<br /><br />(update after a couple of weeks of use)<br />The product does work well.  Yes there are some lumps but if you manually hit the blend button for a bit longer you can get a very smooth puree for your child.<br />The one other issue I have found is that the blade is a bit difficult to take off.  I have to pull it quite hard 40% of the time - hard enought that I though I was going to break the plastic.  My wife felt the same way.  So my rating of 3 stars don't change, however it is stable and good product and we do use it daily.<br /><br />Overall the product works.  However I did have one major problem.  The first time I tried to use the product, it would steam, and the motor would turn on but the blade wouldn't spin.  I called up Baby Brezza and it turns out they had a manufacturing issue where the belt had slipped off the cog for the blade.  They knew about the issue and immediately told me to remove the 5 screws from the bottom, remove the cover and slip the belt onto the cog.  All in all, it was easy to do and took all but 5 minutes.  However, the fact that you get a product that would not work right out the box was a huge dissapointment and my wife was really frustrated.<br />On the plus side, the lady at Baby Brezza did know the issue and was able to get me going right away.  First time I have had success with customer service with any company."

One squeeze to 8oz just tasted like it poisoned my water. 2 squeezes darkened the color and made the aftertaste worse. 3 squeezes gave a light fruity hint of  flavor but the bitterness and aftertaste overwhelmed it. Since it tastes like cough syrup I did not try 4 squeezes. I might mention the aftertaste is like diet dinks with artificial sugar that makes the roof of your mouth feel caked up. So I did drink tons of good old fashioned plain water to get rid of it. So it really does make you drink more water but not for the reasons it claims.

They looked melted, and they were soft. I had read some reviews that people got melted ones, but I ordered mine in April, a cold april, and the temperatures hadn't been over 55 degrees. It hasn't been hot enough to melt them! I've had chocolate melt on me before, and then harden back up. It looks a little glossy, sometimes white on the surfaces, and is usually denser (not lighter/softer/greasier), but I've never seen or tasted ""melted"" chocolate like this.<br /><br />Second, they tasted, well, cheap. I still had some of the milk chocolate variety, and I tasted them, bite of one, bite of the other. And there is a big difference. Also, the chocolate in the center of the Amazon one was LOW. Not NEARLY as much as the store bought one.<br /><br />Third, I stuck them in the fridge, thinking that would stiffen them up. I was hoping the off/cheap taste and the softness was from somehow being melted (though even then I had my doubts). They've been in the fridge for two days. I opened one this morning, and they are still as soft and cheap tasting as the one I had before. Also, this one has a poke hole in one side and a ""plug"" that had fallen out. This plug was big and light colored and soft. It seems obvious that its not the same qulity of chocolate and that the process that poked the hole in the side and ""plugged"" it was not the regular Lindor method! I compared it to one of the store bought ones, and it looked NOTHING like the storebought ones. It just looks terrible.<br /><br />I am not a chocolate expert, and can't say for sure that this is not because of them being melted, but they look ALTERED to me, and taste CHEAP and OILY - GREASY like they were cut with much cheaper chocolate. I don't know how the packaging and wrappers would be Lindor while the chocolate isn't, but that's how they looked and tasted - different. Can melting change the density, texture and taste of cholocate? Maybe, but, in my experience, not like this.<br /><br />I am beyond suspicious and into nervous. I ATE these, and I don't know what they are! They don't look or taste real! It makes me sick to my stomach to think they might have been altered or cut or faked.<br /><br />I am very disappointed, and am sticking to the more expensive store bought. My sister and her friends are just going to have to deal with a plain old one flavor bowl full.<br /><br />I really hope I'm wrong, but buyer beware. If they look funny, feel soft and have fishy looking poke holes/plugs, think twice. Eat them if you want to, but mine went in the garbage."
21568,Julia Kuiper,1,I ordered the Teenie pack of Greenies that was supposed to come with 96 teenie sized chews. I ended up receiving a pack with 52 teenie sized chews and 8 large chews. I returned the product because I did not receive what I ordered. Amazon couldn't replace my order because they couldn't guarantee I would get the right product if ordered again.
114456,John Gray,1,If it were not so much trouble I would return this product. I am a great blue cheese lover but these olives do not contain anywhere near the blue cheese I am accustomed to. The cheese is so mild it might as well not even be in the olives. The olives are OK but to pretend they are stuffed with blue cheese is a grossly misleading statement.

This stolen was a complete waste of my money (with shipping, almosty $30).<br />The sugar covering was not powdered by a glaze that cracked when I cut it. The cake was dry and tasteless and crumbled when I cut it. I was okay with paying $30 for what I thought would be a good stoeln but this was not good at all.

However this aroma is not of natural origin, the added chemical scent destroyed the original smell. Giving this tea bag a few dips in 80 degree c hot water (which is how hot the water should be at) this tea is low grade at best. It does not give a soothing taste after you drink it rather it leaves bitter taste all over. Also, for people who like strong tea tastes, this tea bag has nothing of that.

Once you are able to get the thin cello off the licorice you are met with very hard, and impossible to take the licorice apart to eat. What little you could break off was hard and stale. Very disappointed in the product and am even more disappointed with the way the company has handled it (or I should say hasn't handled it) I contacted them and they haven't bothered responding to my correspondance. We paid a premium price for the licorice 8.99 a package and ended up throwing out the total product because it was simply unacceptable and impossible to enjoy. So, on two notes , I would be cautious about ordering from them, because there is a chance they won't bother to answer your correspondance and secondly the product they delivered us wasn't remotely like the old fashioned spearmint licorice that we enjoyed as kids.

However, the most recent shipment of 5 bottles were either soured or spoiled, albeit they had a product quality expiration date in 2013.  And, the replacement I requested was also soured or spoiled.

I haven't reviewed many products on here, but feel obligated for this one because in my opinion/experience, it's an expensive (in volume) dud.<br /><br />  I have seed/pantry moths that were introduced from bird seed for my macaw. The moths spread to the pantry, and are a major hassle to eradicate. It is very difficult to kill all cyles of moth production from eggs=>larvae=>moths. Most of the pantry moth traps help reduce the nuisance and volume of moths by attracting male moths to a sticky surface via a pheromone.<br /><br />  Several brands of moth traps I've tried have worked well... to date, Safer Brand has been the unfortunate exception. I bought 3 boxes of Safer Brand Pantry Pest Traps at Lowe's... 4 of the traps are seen in my video (totally empty). Unfortunately, I have another $32 of these traps being delivered shortly from an online ACE hardware dealer (AG Lock seemed to come in slightly cheaper than other Amazon 3rd parties). I note that, unlike others, the pheromone from Safer Brand had no odor; I also noticed that the sticky surface available to trap the moths was smaller (cheap?).<br /><br />The brand that worked well was Biocare, though I remember several other brands working decently (as mentioned the moths are hard to eradicate but the traps really<br /><br />Hey... even though these traps were a TOTAL waste of time and money for me, your mileage may be different.

192885,Bonnie,1,"I would give it no stars if that were possible. I found Enchantacat in California and my cats loved it when we would bring it home. I ordered it the first time from an Amazon Prime seller and it arrived looking like someone broke into it thinking it was something other than catnip. The seal was busted. My cats wouldn't touch it and after putting it outside by a garbage can where the stray cats in my hood congregate, and seeing it untouched, I figured it was just a bad batch.<br /><br />My boyfriend ordered it from another seller. This time it arrived sealed, but it was just nothing the cats wanted any part of. I am not sure if the forumula is different now, or if my cats are just used to bad catnip, but two batches have had no effect on drawing out cats to engage in it.<br /><br />Other catnips, when we put it down, my cats will smell it from the other side of the house.

I really dislike wintergreen, but hoped as the last ingredient on the label, that the wintergreen component of the flavor wouldn't be noticeable.  However, wintergreen oil is powerful stuff, and it really overwhelms the green tea and peppermint/spearmint components.  Honestly, I think I'd prefer a more straightforward mix of green tea and peppermint and/or spearmint leaves, without additional ingredients like lemongrass, ginger, and especially wintergreen."

I have fairly good diet control, so I assumed it was the low-carb construction. Having not eaten a low-carb pasta before, I was theorizing on it's effects.<br /><br />I then did some independent web research on this suspicion. And other people also had the same experience after having eaten this product. It does not leave you full. This defeats the purpose of eating.<br /><br />Buying this product at any price was a waste if I was not nourished. I might as well only had been imagining about eating.

The advertised picture shown is a larger size(1 oz), but what was actually sent was much smaller(0.5 oz). We could have gotten 50% more of the same exact product for less. We paid $10.79 for 0.5 oz when we could have paid $9.15 for 1oz. Product itself is great and our cat loves it, we just overpaid and lesson learned."

Seriously, it does. I bought this because it was cheaper than all the other coffees on the shelf and as it turns out, i got what i paid for. If you are an instant coffee person stick with Starbucks Via or something like that as this is not really worth your time. Im gonna finish out the box though, since caffeine is my crack. Wish me luck."

555587,Jayson D. Barrons,1,"I assumed for the price I would get as much mix as I would from carb quik or some of the other low carb baking mixes I have purchased.  What you're actually getting is a whopping 2 cups of mix (notice how they say ""2 packs"" in the description and then label the amount by weight). The 10 servers is horse manure - they increase the serving count to lower the per serving carbs and mislead as to how much you actually get out of it. I got about 8 medium sized pancakes out of this.<br /><br />It's also a dryer, slightly more bitter mix than either the atkins or carbquik mixes.<br /><br />I haven't been this disappointed in a purchase in quite a long time."

I could only make it drinkable by adding some milk and a packet of matcha tea.  I am super disappointed in this product, as most of the other t-disc coffees from tassimo are pretty good.  Don't waste your money on this - it's just as easy to use a pre-packaged tea bag and it will taste much better."

409365,A.nonymous,1,"My family fell in love with Haribo Raspberries this fall when we tried our first bag from a local store-they were an instant hit.  Fresh, vibrant colors, the non-pareils (sugar balls) on the outside burst in your mouth as you tasted them.  Yum!<br /><br />However, I was instantly disappointed when the box I ordereed from Amazon arrived, instead of a fresh, vibrant red, the berries that should have been red were a faded, dingy tan-peach color.  The black ones were still black, but when you handled them it left a brown residue on your fingers as if the color was leaching out of them.<br /><br />The color wasn't the only problem-the non-pareils didn't have that ""burst"" quality, they were rather bland and tasted old.  I think the candy was old, or perhaps improperly stored, because it was still within the expiration date by a few months.  Whatever the case, the large bag was nowhere near the quality or flavor that the locally purchased Haribo Raspberries were, and I'll not make that mistake again."

This is a brand and flavor that my dog eats regularly, which we purchase from PetCo and have purchased in the past from Amazon.  He has never had any problem with it until this case.  Some of the cans were dented and I believe it must have been exposed to high heat or something.  I've thrown out can after can that has caused him to be ill.  I have waited several days before trying another can, and again, the same thing.  He has been throwing up all day.  I will never purchased canned food from Amazon again."

315395,Foxdown,1,"We were quite disappointed with this product. They arrived quickly enough but when we opened the box and viewed one of cigars it looked just awful. One can only describe it as mottled in the extreme. We then opened a second and third cigar and find they were all the same. Certainly not something we would want to pass out. The question was, 'could we safely eat these?'. We each had one and while they tasted good enough for what they represented, and we are still alive to report on the them, we still felt that by looks alone it would turn folks off. Was this a one off box? We don't know but have no intention of finding out. There are other sources for the same product."

To try to make up for the poor quality of the product and the money I wasted buying it, I tried filling the bottles for reuse with my own filtered water but it just tasted musty, like it was going bad...really bad.  So I ended up just recycling the nice bottles.  As far as flavor goes....there is not any flavor, none at all.  It turns out to be just an expensive way to drink bottled water.  Not worth it by any means.  I don't know how the other reviewers could come to different conclusions but in my opinion....this bottled water is a big waste of money and I will never be buying it again."

Fed my Bichon just a small handful of this food the next day, and while he loved the taste, he was UP ALL NIGHT WITH DIARRHEA that lasted into the next day. He's still recovering.

71512,"Stacy ""cheetaah""",1,"Granted, I tried to doctor this mix up based upon some other reviews and my own baking experience pre-gluten-free, but I imagine if these muffins tasted as bad as they did doctored up, this is a pretty sorry mix.  It is possible that I just got a bad bag, but the expiration date was still 11 months away so no excuse.  I added orange juice and yogurt in place of water for moisture, and added 1/3C brown sugar as a sweetener.  I threw in a large dash of flax seed meal (which I add to everything I bake GF for fiber and protein).  I added butter (whirred with the brown sugar to start) in place of oil, and 1C frozen blueberries since the goal was blueberry muffins.  They were awful enough, literally like paste, that I had to spit out what I ate and so did my husband.  But the kids had fun making them and actually like them.  Good thing I made banana bread muffins from scratch the same day or I would have been really disappointed."

Amazon replace order, came UPS this time instead of USPS, air pillows were again torn and flat, but only one can barely dented,...Also, i opened one of the dented cans from the first order, bad smell and food was pulled away from the sides, so take care with dented cans of dog/cat food"

To look cool.  Fit in with the hipsters.  A month later, heck - for me it was half a day - I'm a certified Ratch Head, holding a bottle of the Red Devil upside down like a plasma bag, sucking the heat from a clear plastic tube that I ripped from my little girl's aquarium air pump.  The fish died, but I didn't care.  They tasted sooo goooooood.<br /><br />I lost everything.  My faith in ketchup.  My faith in Chinese mustard.

When the intervention happened, they found me curled up in the Specialty Foods Aisle of Target with a fiery cake of Ratch and oyster crackers pasted to my face and clothes.<br /><br />Rehab taught me that once a Ratch Head, always.  I met people there who assured me that I was ok without Sriracha.  That I didn't NEED heat.  The doctors, Mr. Heinz and Mrs. French put me on a new diet of quiet, soft condiments that - well, sure.  They don't have flavor, but they're certainly not making me think of them every hour of the day, either.<br /><br />I have a steady job now, new friends and tonight, we're getting together for Tuna Helper and instant lemonade.<br /><br />Stay away from Srirach sauce.<br /><br />Wait.

424877,Sterghe,1,"See that disclaimer on the product page that says the actual ingredients may differ from what's listed? Apparently, the manufacturer thinks it's OK to switch to using the ""Big 8"" allergens; there's no milk listed in the published ingredients, but there it is on the side of the box.<br /><br />Two differences that will seem trivial to anyone who doesn't care about milk products: the ingredients list online says, ""coconut milk solids,"" and the list on the box reads, ""coconut, milk solids."" The allergen statement on the box clearly indicates it contains milk products.<br /><br />Since I am allergic to milk, I couldn't try the actual product; I have no opinion of its quality.<br /><br />:( And I love curry!!"

Translated: Probably contaminated. My advice, especially for those of us who are super sensitive? Take the time to find truly gluten free Buckwheat Flour from someone else.<br /><br />I've written to Hodgson Mills about their practice, so perhaps one day they will change things.<br /><br />In the meantime, there are companies that produce Buckwheat Flour specifically labeled Gluten Free, and I'll definitely be looking for one of them the next time I visit a gluten-free friendly store."

I've seen more appetizing grizzly bear poop that probably would've tasted better.<br /><br />I picked these up from the post office and was hungry and thought I'd try them.  Strawberry, organic and all natural -- sounded really good.  I eat organic and all natural foods, so it's not like I'm  unfamiliar with the concept.  The box said they were vegan.  Okay, not all vegan stuff is great, but a lot is pretty tasty.  This stuff is horrid.  I can't begin to tell you what they taste like -- sickly sweet paste with sawdust and a bit of strawberry flavor might come close.  The word ""super food"" is a lie -- I hated the bar immediately, regardless of how good it was supposed to be for me.  I handed a piece to my husband who likes twigs and granola and he made a face.  One of my dogs took a sniff and walked away.  I convinced her to take a piece and she set it down and sort of ate it --  and then looked at me like I had played some cruel joke.<br /><br />Now I'm stuck with 11 bars to foist off on people I hate.

DO I love spicy and hot flavored anything?  Yes!  This sauce did not even provide a bit of a kick.  Nothing.  Just creamy awkward tasting blandness.  To add insult to injury Amazon decided to ship me expired products.  Yes... expired.  I took the risk and still tried it but I still found the taste to be bland.  I am hoping that my taste was off because it was not used by the :best if used by date:, because in my opinion it is best if it is never used.<br /><br />Do not recommend and very disappointed in the fact that Amazon sent an expired product to a consumer.  I usually love Taco Bell's little packets and had high hopes for their new creamy/spicy line.  Sadly... I was not impressed.  I will also be reviewing another variety and had the same experience.

489243,Kathleen Sales,1,"When I adopted my rescue lab/chow mix, Sammie, the shelter said she was eating Purina One Lamb and Rice. So that is what I kept feeding her without knowing what I know now that I have read this site. But it seemed ok - she had really hard poops sometimes but otherwise seemed great and her coat was soft and shiny, enough so that people commented on it. THEN after the formula change this year, the itching started and the poops became worse (hard more often.) She developed red spots in her ears and a yeast infection in each one.  Then her fur got rough, dusty looking and then started shedding more than anything I'd seen in the 2 years I had her. It seemed like she lost 1/2 her fur! The vets told me this was not likely the new food formula of her same food...well after hundreds of dollars of vet bills and a miserable summer for her all itchy all of the time, I decided to change her food. I picked Halo after talking to a friend who is in to nutrition (people and dogs.) I changed her over slowly - about 9 days. The itching and fur remained a problem...until the day she was only on Halo. Poof! No more itching - that very day no more itching. After a month her fur was shiny and soft but sparce (I'd added Halo's Dreamcoat supplement too.) After 2 months her fur is shinier, softer and more full and lush than ever. Her poops are regular like clockwork and soft - like they never were on Purina One. And she *loves* the food! (I do a mix of canned and kibble.) She has a passion for that food she never had for Purina One - even before the formula change. I wish I'd listened to my instincts and switched the food after the first symptoms! Whatever Purina did to that food is a nightmare.  Read about in on line - you'll see many people have had very bad results since the formula change last summer."

326647,"Richard A. Terbrock ""IBMrT""",1,"First of all, my favorite K Cup is the Timothy's Colombian Decaffeinated.  If you are looking for an excellent cup of coffee, I highly recommend Timothy's.  Secondly, it is my understanding that Timothy's is packaged by Green Mountain Coffee. Again, I have never been disappointed by Green Mountain products.  Unfortunately, there comes a time that something goes wrong in the process and you just have to get it off your chest.<br />This package of 50 was not typical.  I have had others in the past and they were neatly packaged in a Timothy's box.  In this case, the package was simply a cardboard box with 50 K cups inside.  What's really different about this order is the incredible poor quality of the K Cups.  It's like they bundled all of the bad production products and stuck then in box to sell on Amazon.<br />We've all heard of the exploding K Cups, but what's really happening is that the small filter inside the K Cup is not bonded properly to the side of the K Cup, and the coffee flows into the bottom of the K Cup and into your cup.  The coffee is not drinkable and you have to pour it out and waste another K Cup.  At today's prices, that's a problem.  I have had a few of these in the past, but this batch is particularly bad.  I have gone through 20 of the 50 K Cups now, and 10 have been defective. Every time, I carefully remove the foil top to find the filters are not properly attached to the side of the plastic K Cup.  What's really bad, is I have 30 of these left.<br />My advice to you is stay away from these 50 packs if you can.  I have not had any real problems when purchasing 2 24 count boxes, but I think these are factory rejects, which are costing me double the price I had expected to pay."

238787,H.

I'd hope not but thats what this food is. remember you get what you pay for, and paying so little for that amount doesn't make you wonder? Would you buy a $2 stake? no, you'd wonder why it was so cheap... because it crap! Good food requires dogs to eat less because their getting more nutrients from a smaller amount, so their eat less,poop less, and shed less. their skin and coat recieve more nutrients,they have firmer stool, and their overall body is being takin care of. Some better dog foods off of hand:Blue Buffalo,Orijen,Wellness,Nutro,Natural balance,Castor and pollux. these are just a couple of foods of the top of my head that are holistic and natural, but its important to research and shop around and find whats good for your dog.

105118,Heza,1,"I had high hopes for Blue Buffalo Kitten food. I feed all my animals high quality food, my 3 dogs are on Nutro Ultra Holistic (small breed), and unfortunately there is no equivalent for cats. I narrowed my food choices down to Blue, Innova, and Wellness. You get the most Blue Buffalo for the money so that is what I decided to go with. Within days of bringing my 4 month old kitten home from the humane society he developed diarrhea. I chalked it up to stress and switching foods. Imagine my surprise when the diarrhea never went away. I wanted to see if anyone else was having the same problem. Google ""Blue Buffalo kitten diarrhea"" and you will see others having the same issue. If it's not diarrhea it's smelly poops in general. I wish I knew what was causing this, if it's an ingredient he's allergic to or something else. I just started him on Innova and will update if the diarrhea subsides.<br /><br />My kitten seemed to enjoy the food though, he would gobble it up no problem, life source bits and all. The small kibbles make it easier for a mess to be made if you have a messy eater. If you are going to try this food, just monitor their feces for changes in consistency and smell, as this food has been shown to cause issues in some cats. If my kitten wasn't having issues on this food I would probably give it 5 stars for value, flavor, and ingredients.<br /><br />Edit: After a few weeks on Inova the diarrhea has completely cleared up and not returned! It was definitely Blue Buffalo that caused his issues. I guess this food really isn't for all cats."

We all tried both the cola flavor as well as the ginger root beer flavor and, after about 1/2 of a small glass, every one of us (including my young kids) said, ""Ick!"" At the first taste, it is o.k. But, after you've had a few drinks, there is very little to differentiate Zevia's taste from any other diet soda.  I guess if you are a normal diet soda drinker, this might be a wise, somewhat more natural alternative.

Steam function works great, but the motor would never turn the blender blade so my food just sat there.  Luckily there's an easy fix.  I took the entire unit apart and found that the belt from the motor was not engaging the turnshaft that would in turn enable the blade to spin.  After properly aligning the belt I put it all back together and the unit now blends like it is supposed to.  My guess is that this is the same problem that caused others' blender function to not work.  I would futher venture that the Brezza knows about this issue and has done nothing to correct it.  It's hard to believe that after multiple complaints about the same problem that Brezza does not put its units through some sort of inspection process to prevent this from happening.

59961,SmallTownLady,1,"Since the formula change, this tea is nothing special.  For many years, I have been addicted to Starbucks Black Iced Tea.  I live in a little town in the midwest that doesn't even have a Starbucks, but I have a gold Starbucks card.  I would check every route when travelling to plan stops for this iced tea.  I have purchased the quart sized bags from Starbucks and Target when available and ordered the gallon bags when that was my only option to brew this tea daily.  I started noticing a change when I was in South Carolina in March, 2012.  I thought maybe southerners just have a different tea preference.  I then noticed it in Nashville over the summer.  Since I spend time regularly in Nashville, I knew a change was on the way.  The tea has lost its crispness and citrus finish.  It seems Starbucks has purchased Tazo from Steven Smith and decided to change it.  I hate to think it was to make more money with a cheaper blend, but I haven't been able to find another reason.  Given the fact that I was paying over $3.00 per Trenta, I can't imagine the mark up was unfair to them no matter what the cost of the original tea.  By buying Tazo, Starbucks cut out the middle man to make way for more profits, then made major change.  Couldn't it just have started its own tea brand?  It has lost a loyal customer in me (and many transfers from my bank account to the Starbucks card).  If you are loyal to taste rather than brand, start your search for a new tea.  I have started my search with the former owner of Tazo who has opened a new business.  Maybe the old formula will come back before we find something we like better."

The box said 2 day air, but it wasn't.  I'm very disappointed with this item.  Was supposed to be a gift. but now it's dead.  Becareful of ording plants in the winter time.  I live in Michigan.

There is no option to buy humidity tray with order.<br /><br />Vendor gives cut and dry resposes. No effort is being made to accommodate customers expectation."

227283,Dissatisfied Customer,1,Big disappointment both in flavor and appearance. Too many pieces were shriveled and mottled with unsightly shell residue.

431077,hw,1,"I ordered these red only M&Ms to make an M&M cake for a baby shower, and I still have not received them more than 3 weeks later. The shower has already passed, so I ended up having to buy 20 bags of M&Ms to get the amount of red ones that I needed. It is not a very popular color in the mixed bags. The seller states that the order is on the way, and therefore, I cannot cancel it. Now I am stuck with a ton of multi-colored M&Ms and a maybe a bag of red ones and I had to pay $20 in addition to the $10 that I originally paid. Overall, this experience was horrible, due to the extremely slow shipping. Also, when I ordered the M&Ms, it said that they would be delivered in 5-7 business days, and I never received a notice that they were out of stock or on back order."
253537,vox unpopuli,1,"This mushroom bruschetta is extremely salty - too salty to taste any actual flavor. I definitely do not recommend it.<br /><br />The jars are tiny, so think twice how you feel about spending over four dollars on a small 6-ounce jar.<br /><br />Apparently food returns are not allowed on Amazon, even if the packaging is still intact. I contacted customer service about the remaining 3 jars that I never touched, because they are really too expensive for me just to discard (and I certainly would not feel comfortable giving away something so inedible to friends and family), so we'll see if anything comes out of that.<br /><br />But again, unless you are familiar with this flavor and are sure that you will be able to eat it, you might want to refrain from ordering a pack of four."

45904,Biblioholic Beth,1,"I love ginger - I have been known to make pots of tea from fresh ginger and honey, and I'm finishing off a ginger syrup that I made that is fantastic with bubbly water (and even vodka). So, I was looking forward to trying this. Having tried it, I can say that I would not ever purchase this.<br /><br />I tried it hot first, following the instructions (then putting half in the fridge to cool). First, it doesn't look at all like the picture on the outside of the foil packet. Instead of a lovely golden yellow, it is the light brown of a beef or vegetable broth. Hoping that wasn't a harbinger of things to come, I sat down to enjoy the flavor. Unfortunately, I didn't really enjoy it. There was VERY little lemon flavor - more like a slight lemon aftertaste, and only if you're really looking for it. The overall flavor is much more bitter than fresh ginger would be, with an almost medicinal taste. The ginger bite is there, and is about the only thing that really reminds me of what ginger should be.<br /><br />Then I tried it cold (with an ice cube to help cool it down). The flavor didn't seem as strong, but it still had the bitter taste. After those first few sips of both hot and cold, I honestly couldn't drink any more of this. The aftertaste was too much and I genuinely did not want to finish the drink. So - I didn't.<br /><br />Overall, if you're used to something like Stash Ginger Honey tea, or even tea made from fresh ginger, then this is no substitute. The flavor profile is very different, and the bitterness is hard to get past. If you have the opportunity to try a smaller amount before purchasing this, then I would highly recommend you do so. It definitely seems like something that would appeal to a very specific (and possibly limited) audience."
54186,D. M. Castro,1,"Ordered these to be delivered on the tenth of febuary due to description saying they arrive in bud form. Well I received them on the 14th, Valentines day. Had I wanted to give my wife some ugly closed buds for a valentines day present I would have requested the 14th and not the 10th. So when I realized I would not receive them when requested, a date that would have given them time to open up I had to go purchase flowers locally. Not to mention that upon arrival of said buds, well after one look I can tell you that there is no way in heck that they would bloom to look anything like the picture, seems to be lacking like half the flowers and two of them that were sent have the stems broken not too far below the bulb s so there's two less from the already lacking amount."

465339,Maria,1,"I used these pearls on elephant cookies for a client.  They bled horribly, making each elephant look like it had a black eye.  So I ended up having to explain the issue to the client, which made me look completely inept and unprofessional... and I stayed up most of the night rebaking and redecorating them and delivered the cookies just before the event started.  I emailed Wilton customer service and they said that it's common for colored pearls/sprinkles to bleed because of the moisture in the icing.  Basically, ""tough luck.""  Other brands don't bleed, so Wilton is full of crap.  They have lost me as a customer... I will never buy as much as a bakery box from them again."

They must be served to people in jail as punishment for their acts, so I found another motivation to behave (just in case). Don't think to much, if you are using tomato sauce and no salt,just buy whole grain pasta and you will be fine It is only 100-200 calories you safe and not worth the taste and the smell. But keep some of this noodles in your house in case of an unwanted neighbor kid wants to stay for dinner, take video of his face and make some money in AFV. So I hate the product but helped me to motivate myself to workout,stop eating calories and fats just to avoid the taste of the noodles, also to love myself as fat as I am and last to fear jail for the fact that food could taste like this.<br />Safe your money, if you want to waste it, buy me a nice plate of real pasta, the only miracle here is that some other reviewers liked it, ""It is for taste is that colors exist"""

I can't understand how someone would rate this crappy basket of crap 5 stars.<br /><br />Obviously I wouldn't buy again, but in terms of subjective value...

It's not the same drink and it's extremely unpleasant.  I'm really disappointed to lose my favorite low-calorie drink."
471612,MT,1,"When I put my dogs on the new diet, it took about 4-5 weeks for their stomachs to adjust because they were getting extremely bad farts. After that, they were fine and healthy on it with shiny coats.<br /><br />HOWEVER, upon receiving my third Diamond Naturals Chicken & Rice, they developed awful diarrhea and stomach problems (April 15ish). A couple days later, I found out the Lamb & Rice formula was recalled, but I suspected something was wrong with the Chicken & Rice. Amazon refunded me, and I insisted they should talk to Diamond Naturals and put a warning on their site. I called Diamond Naturals and they said our dogs probably received a bad batch unrelated to the Lamb & Rice and they would be happy to pay for our next bag. We didn't want to risk it and decided to make our own food.<br /><br />Now the cat is out of the bag, and Diamond is recalling ALL SKU's (as of May 4, 2012, today), including several other brands they distribute. Humans have become infected with salmonella from handling the dog food. This is absolutely disgusting and unacceptable. I am hoping that after this event, there will be more regulations for dog food so that we know our pets can have healthy, affordable food. For now I'm not trusting any dog food brand (that I can afford) and will have my dogs on a raw diet.<br /><br />SOURCES:<br /><br />[...]"
37656,MizG,1,"I should have known better than to order chocolate this time of year.  Most shippers refuse to ship chocolate to Florida in the summer.  As a Prime member I thought it might have been packaged well enough to get here in good shape.  There was nothing in the package to protect it from the heat and what should have been delightful little bites of chocolate covered pomegranate turned out to be a two pound block of chocolate with little bits of 'gummy' candy discs.  They may have been made with some pomegranate juice but not enough to give it that 'kick' that real pomegranate juice has.  Even if I see them on a shelf in a store and I can tell from feeling the package that they have not all melted together, I wouldn't spend this much money for so little pomegranate."
386096,Lightning Hunter,1,"Immediately after opening a box of Lipton Mandarin Orange tea, I had a feeling it would not be good.  The smell of the tea bags reminded me of orange antacid tablets (Tums, anyone?).  I figured I would still give it a try, since tea doesn't always taste like it smells.  I was correct.  The tea tasted nothing like Tums; in fact, it had no taste at ALL.  I was relieved that I didn't have to drink tums in the form of tea, but the complete lack of taste wasn't much better.  It's rare that I dislike a tea enough to actually come onto Amazon and type a negative review like this, but this tea definitely qualifies.  I enjoy a lot of other Lipton tea - including the Island Mango & Peach, and Blueberry Pomegranate, but this tea does not fall under the category of good Lipton teas by a long shot.  If you enjoy eating orange Tums and drinking tasteless tea, go ahead and purchase this one.  Otherwise, stay away!"

174484,Photohombre,1,"I'll say for starters that I am a caffeine junkie.  I have been a coffee drinker since I was a very, very young lad.  For the past fifteen years I have only purchased whole beans and for the past five years I have used a French press.  I've varied my purchases so that I can enjoy different blends and coffees from different continents, coffees that fulfill my morning quest for the perfect cup.  I had never tried Jamaica Blue Mountain (having read lots of tales of its great taste and quality production) I wanted to try a small amount before I would shell out close to $40 for a pound of this sought-after bean.  I am sure glad I just got a 4oz portion.  This is the worst - absolutely bar none (and that includes chow-hall coffee from my military service years)  The taste is flatter than flat, the aroma is non-existent - in short it is awful.  Thinking I might have somehow done something wrong I brewed another batch in the drip-coffee machine rather than the French press.  It was just as blah.  Maybe I got a bad batch but for sure I will quickly return to my old faithful Yirgercheffe.  As The Who sang ""We won't get fooled again!"""

As a red rose tea the richness of color and flavor can be compared by buying other loose Tea brands and brewing the exact weight vs. Lipton.

Mango was definitely the main ingredient, although to my dismay there is also other juices blended in (grape juice) I'm sure as filler but either way if I am special ordering something I'd like it pure. It tasted great, although the real reason I am giving it a 3 star is because it did not come as pictured. It arrived in a cardboard carton. I was really hoping for the glass one pictured, or at the very least plastic."

These snacks have 130 calories per serving, Frito-Lay Funyuns have only 120 calories in the same size package (28g). Funyuns also have less sodium. Veggie straws might have 2% of the RDA of vitamin C but thats about as healthy as it gets. To put that in perspective, a medium tomato (an actual vegetable) has over 60% of the RDA of Vitamin C.<br /><br />This is an empty calorie snack that is no more healthy than anything else in the snack isle. It's made almost exclusively from processed potatoes and corn, the same as any other salty junk food."
6713,Dmitry Kristal,3,"Looks can be deceiving, especially with this product:  The cute, tiny can looks great, but don't fall for it!  This little guy packs an amazing 140 calories per 8.3 oz can.  My favorite 24 oz Arizona Iced Tea(black/white tea with sugar) has almost just as many calories(150) and almost 3 times the size of Switch.  Also, do not be tempted with ""100% Vitamin C and 20% Vitamin E"" pitch either.  Most of us consume 100% of daily Vitamin C without even trying through foods and anything extra get eliminated.<br /><br />The taste however does feel a bit more natural than other artificial orange sodas though, so that's the only plus.  Also, if you do not worry about gaining weight, I guess this is a good way to get a sugar rush in a tiny can.<br /><br />Overall, a good-tasting product, but there are many other low-caloric alternatives out there.  A can of Diet Coke and a multivitamin anyone?"

Would I order it again, probably, but only as a novelty coffee, never as a mainstay."

157095,"Ulalume Jones ""Creative Gal""",3,"First off, it had a strange scent when I opened the bag.  Something fake, but not even dessert like.  More like a Yankee Candle, wax and all.  I decided to try it anyway.  I was very careful with the brew, since I have read other reviews. I got it to only have a slightly bitter aftertaste by stopping brewing a few minutes early.  I am thinking the fine grade makes it hard to brew, where whole beans would be better.  After weighing it down a bit with sugar and milk, it's ok.  Not horrible, not great, ok.  I've heard good things about this company, but wouldn't buy any other coffees from them if they are like this."
175884,C. Pape,3,"The trick with smoked or salk cured ham, is you need to skin it then soak what your gunna eat in water for a while to extract the salt.  It will still be salty but not as bad. You can always dress it with the tradtional pinapple or brown sugar for that sweet and salty taste.  Thin slices also help.  I am SOO sorry to hear about your Easter Ham.  I had a very similar incident with a smoked turkey for Christmas.  It was over smoked and the meat had turned to paste. Hope this helps."
139253,Kitten Kisser,3,"The closest description I can think of for this product is any organic nut butter.  The oil separates & sits on top of the flesh.  Two difference are this needs to be rather warm in order to mix the oil back into the flesh.  Once you accomplish this task, it will re-separate in 24 hours.<br /><br />After leaving this to warm overnight on my electric space heater, I opened it up & prepared to stir it.  This was a messy affair & I tired of it quickly.  I scooped everything out of those horrible plastic containers & plopped it all into a glass mason jar.  I then got out my hand held immersion blender & proceeded to blend.  This took some time & initially the end result was worth it.  It was smooth & creamy dreamy!  I added a bit to my morning oatmeal & the flavor was amazing.  Surprisingly it did not add a coconut flavor, it created a buttery flavor.  I was impressed.<br /><br />I patted myself on the back too soon when by the next (keeping it warm on my space heater so I could use it as it is like a rock cool) the oil already separated from the flesh. I am accustomed to dealing with real food.  You know food - stuff that doesn't have a bunch of crap added to it.  I grow, raise & grind my own.  I buy organic & only organic.  My point?  This stuff was even more work than I wanted to deal with!<br /><br />My next attempt was to make an icing replacing butter with the coconut.  Oh my! Delicious!  All I did was combine organic confectioners sugar with the coconut & mix it with my hand mixer.  It turned out creamy with a light coconut flavor.  I loved it!  I put it in the refrigerator & then worried that it would turn hard as a rock.  Not so, it was simply perfect!<br /><br />My last attempt, I tried to recreate my icing.  I guess my house was too cold.  What a mess.  Eventually the bulb went off in my head to put the mixing bowl on the stove to warm it while using the hand mixer.  This did the job.  The next day I decided to enjoy some more coco-nutty icing & I just hated it.  Not sure why exactly.  It didn't turn out exactly the same as the first amazing batch.  I can't put my finger on what turned me off so badly but that is it for me.<br /><br />I am sticking with coconut butter & coconut oil.  This stuff is simply too much work & I can get the results I desire using either of the just mentioned forms of coconut with a heck of a lot less work.<br /><br />I removed a star for the plastic packaging.  What makes it worse is the need to keep this warm for use.  At the very least, get this stuff out of the plastic & into glass pronto for your healths sake!  If you love this type of whole coconut puree, try Wilderness Family Naturals.  They sell the exact same stuff in glass!  You can find them on Amazon & they have their own website.<br /><br />I removed a second star for the difficulty to use & my sudden dislike.  Excluding the chemicals that leach into the coconut, the only ingredient is whole coconut & it is Organic.  Vegans, this is a great alternative to butter on your toast, veggies & more!  It is way better than the fake stuff marketed as food to Vegans."

I've given her Zuke's beef treats and she liked it very much, so thought would try peanut butter.  She tolerates one a day (I'm giving it to her for the glucomasine part) but thats it.  Will go back to beef after this bag runs out.  Just a heads up!  I still like Zukes' products tho!"
309457,Zombiegirl,3,"This is my first Foods Alive product. I like them, but don't like them a lot. My biggest problem is that if you eat more then two or three crackers they coat your teeth and you spend the next half hour trying to get it off with your tongue! I will buy more and will try different flavors and varities. They are better with some kind of dip or cheese then just plain in my opinion."
634,Brian Bean,3,Miss Vickies are better but unfortunately less widely available.  I'm not sure tough is the right word but there is a noticeable difference between the two brands and Miss Vickie's are better IMHO.

The can design is pleasant to look at.<br /><br />I thought the Black Cherry flavor tasted a bit too apple-ly, but my wife really liked the flavor.  Also, at 130 calories per can, this beverage has almost 50% more calories per ounce than the average soda.  Too many for me."

225464,lprkaun,3,"I tried these after reading several reviews (including some mention in reviews of other brands of wasabi peas).  I was not impressed.  While not terrible, they didn't seem to have a lot of wasabi flavor, I could eat a handful without noticing, and they seemed much higher in calories than some other brands I've tried.  Do yourself a favor and give these a pass."

458185,T. Roberts,3,"From all that I read on this stuff, I thought it would taste much better than it does.  The problem is, I have nothing to compare it too.  I guess I need to try another brand to see if what I got just wasn't right?"
65398,Nobody important,3,"If you take regular, old salted cashews and add some pepper yourself, it will taste like this.  The sea salt does not appreciably alter the taste.  However, salted cashews with pepper are a tasty snack.  Good, but nothing special."

500203,"Kathryn K. Sweet ""cat lover""",3,I bought this pasta because as a diabetic I am interested on lower my glycemic index and I really enjoy eating pasta.  It tastes great- no real difference in flavor from regular pasta- cooks in the same amount of time and the pasta water is great for thickening the sauce.<br /><br /> My only negative comment is the order I received has a few small beetles in it- I froze all the pasta to kill them but still occasionally find one floating in the pasta water that I have to pluck out.  Apparently pasta is a common way for them to enter the house as pasta is never heated when it is made- just dried/cut and boxed.
63726,Cute Chihuahua,3,I have never tried an illy product before but I love coffee and was excited to try this product. I like the taste of this espresso flavored drink for the most part but it has a slightly artificial taste to it. Each 6.8 fluid ounce can has 50 calories. They display it on the can in a way that leads you to believe that should be good but straight espresso doesn't have any calories so 50 calories worth of sweetener seems like a lot to me. The size of the can is quite small as well. For the cost of this product I would think that they could be a little more generous with the size of the drink. It's nice and convenient while on the go and I like the energy boost from the caffeine.

72043,J. Haggard,3,I've got a bit of a dry scalp sometimes and have tried a number of products to help control the dandruff problem and this shampoo reminded me of Head and Shoulders. It does have a fragrance to it which I would rather it not but it is not over powering. If this shampoo stays on the lower side of the price range of head and shoulders I could see using this. If not I'll probably just stick with head and shoulders.<br /><br /> I did have the same issue a number of other people reported in shipping of the shampoo where it actually was leaking in the package. I hope that CLEAR or Amazon remedies this and pads the shampoo better to prevent leaking. I'll attach a picture to this product page so you can see the shipping issue.
469078,Daniel Tanner,3,So far very good except for 2 tins that when opened were somewhat rancid and had a strong smell. Maybe from shipping damage. The others are fine and I will buy again.
89943,Michael Gallagher,3,"If you put a bowl of this in front of my dog, he will gobble the whole thing up - he really likes, it.  I'm not too sure that is a good thing as, for example, he usually is a self-regulated eater and eats when he is hungry vs. sitting down to what I would compare in human terms of a bowl of buttery popcorn.  I am now only giving him a small portion of this food as a ""treat"" every now and then and have put him back on his normal, healthier dog food."

The service from Amazon.com was terrible, the shipping charged-outrageous, plus the amount of time it took the item to arrive was unacceptable.  I will never again purchase from Amazon.com, and will advise friends and family to follow suit."
315900,F. Hamilton,3,"I love this cheese.  However, it is far to expensive.  I found I can have my local store get Mizithra Cheese for me at about a quarter of the cost of ordering it here."
525118,Kathy R. Schmitt,3,The item is a novelty but found that moisture gathered underneath the plastic cap very easily. I also think they are way too expensive for just having the light in the them.......regular ring pops are much cheaper.They worked for the reason I ordered them but would not order them again.

That said, everyone's system is different. I never take laxatives so I can't compare them to the tea. Unfortunately, this chocolate flavor is faint and rather chalky. I like regular Smooth Move better."
134622,Suz E Q,3,"The product tasted alright, but it wasn't what I expected at all. I thought I'd get a liquid that after spending half an hour in the refrigerator (as directed by the package) would be cold enough to whip into a cream. Instead the consistencly is very viscous and needs to be dug out of the container. It does lighten up a bit when whipped, but not to what I thought I would get. Also,the results are not speadable and doesn't lend itself to acting like a cake topping. I probably wound not reorder this again."
370744,Reader,3,"The Coconut flavor is a good tasting and fairly low-calorie snack.<br /><br />However, not wild about the addition of 'Brown Rice Syrup' (3rd ingredient) and 'Agave Syrup' ingredients.<br /><br />I feel Organic nut butters (peanut, macadamia, walnut, cashew, etc.) could have been added in place of these syrups.<br /><br />Also, I had expected a much higher overall protein count.<br /><br />It would be helpful if complete Nutritional Info (Calories, Fat, Sat Fat, Carbs, Protein, Sugars, etc...) were listed out on Amazon's product pages."
238793,macatac,3,I purchsaed this salt as a replacement for Laury's seasoned salt with Tobasco. There was not much of a comparison because the Laury's salt was just heads above this product but unfortunately they discontinued making the Laury's Tobasco salt. Alas!

""bronxgal""",3,"Our old friend Mr. Peanut is now in the granola bar business.<br />These bars contain peanuts, almonds and cashews, but since they're ""honey roasted"" and contain corn syrup, sugar, evaporated cane juice, and sugar, they are sweeter than this consumer would want, and the flavor of the nuts doesn't come through.  That said, they are only 220 calories, so could be a good quick snack with seven grams of protein (albeit 12 grams of fat, which one would expect from nuts).  If I were a suspicious sort, I'd wonder if the various sugars added so that the manufacturer can say that less than half the calories come from fat."

It's hard to decide after reading tons of ingredient labels on websites for other brands & I chose this one after going to their homepage.

285374,Jamie,3,"I bought this on a whim because 24 flavors for the price seemed to be a good deal.  However, I'm knocking off a star because there are some duplicates (though in some fairness, they're the most likely to be used).  Each of these is a one dram (3/4 teaspoon) bottle so you're likely to get only one batch of candy from each bottle, but it's a good way to experiment.<br /><br />The artificial flavors also contain colorants, which I suppose some people might appreciate since they don't have to use their own food coloring.  However, I prefer to add colorants separately so I can better control the final appearance. So I've also deducted a star for this reason.<br /><br />Natural oils:<br />Anise Oil<br />Orange Oil<br />Lemon Oil<br />Peppermint Oil (3 bottles)<br />Spearmint Oil<br />Clove Oil<br />Cinnamon Oil (4 bottles)<br /><br />Artificial Flavors:<br />Root Beer<br />Watermelon (2 bottles)<br />Raspberry<br />Cran-Raspberry<br />Strawberry<br />Bubble Gum<br />Orange Creme<br />Bavarian Creme<br />Butterscotch<br />Cherry<br />Grape"

It also does not blend very  well, with some of the ""green"" floating on top or remaining at the bottom of your drinking container of choice after you finish. Personally, if I want something this green, I would rather drink Green Magma barley powder or similar product. The Amazing Grass product is drinkable, but it's definitely an acquired taste."

231880,shawn smith,3,I have not bought this online but I know I've seen and bought the 24 packs in stores a lot cheaper and the individual cans a lot cheaper. Here the cans are almost 70 cents per can.  I think at the stores I pay 50 or 55 cents a can.  I think they have the 24 packs cheaper at the dollar store or Freds and I think Walmart but I only go there and in emergencies at night when everything else is closed but they are also about the only place that I've found that sells the tuna and egg flavor that my cat's really love.  I thought Amazon would have a cheaper price then most of the stores but you would probably pay 2 or 3 dollars extra then at the stores and if you couldn't get free shipping I don't know how much extra you would have to pay but all together it would probably be about 5 to 7 dollars extra then just buying it at the store.

There were french vanillas, vanilla francese, vanilla from more than one brand, etc. Plus, they were all thrown into a box haphazardly, which doesn't exactly inspire confidence in the product or its quality. Most recently, I ordered a double-pack with only 2 flavors which defeats the point of a variety pack but at least it showed up in an orderly fashion."

The seller recommends you reserve 1 lb for immediate use in the fridge and to store the remaining 2 lbs in the freezer for rapidly approaching anticipated use.

It's better than drinking a soft drink since the sugar content comes from the fruit juice and isn't artificial.  It's sort of like having a carbonated fruit juice -- they take sparkling water and add fruit juice (70% fruit juice is what the can says).  The cans are small, perfect to pack in a lunch for your kids.  The price of Izze is a little steep, especially since they're good...not great."

It is made from real fruit juice (concentrate), but it has a whopping 35g of sugar.  The main fruit juices, are grape and apple.  As a ""snack"" or ""treat,"" it would be good, but I don't think I would drink it if I was just thirsty.  8.3oz isn't much.  Nice concept similar to an ""energy"" drink, but not just sugar and caffeine.<br /><br />I also made a review of the kiwi and strawberry which tastes slightly better and has 2g less of sugar.  The real reason I gave this product one star less than the other is that Amazon needs to work on their packaging/handling.  See my customer photo.  This item was just plain filthy with some kind of dirty/greasy industrial soot on it.  I had to REALLY scrub it with dishwashing detergent.  After that, it was good! (But, I shouldn't have had to scrub it.)"

Also Xanthan gum gives it an unctuous almost greasy texture. Cain's never used these additives back then and I hope doesn't use them today. That brand is not available here in Florida unfortunately, otherwise I would but that in preference to Howard's."

I like instant miso soup that has the paste and the packet of tofu and dried seaweed better than the powder mix so I was really looking forward to trying this.  Well, I was little disappointed.  The miso has a different taste to it compared to others that I have tasted. It was rather bland, too.  So, overall, this is just okay. I probably won't buy it again."

It is suppose to be  100% juice with vitamin C that has been carbonated. Ok here is my thought either buy 100% orange juice that taste like it came right of the tree or buy a orange pop.

The results are good if not better than soy protein powders. I helps me keep muscle mass (I'm on a masters swim team).<br /><br />The powder tastes fine, but the texture is gritty. It also doesn't mix well with liquids and tends to sink to the bottom. It isn't too bad and I am willing to put up with it unless I can find something better (that isn't soy or whey)."
539007,"tachi1 ""tachi1""",3,"Since these are rather large, just a few go a long way. They are especially nice on cupcakes. The colors are pleasant and they are large enough that you can sort them into piles if you just want only a couple of colors for your theme. A plus is that they don't add a taste of their own to your frosting or stain the frosting with rub-off color.<br /><br />The drawback is that you almost have to place them where you want them, one by one, which ends up looking kind of stilted. They aren't the type of decoration you can sprinkle on (despite the name). A lot of them tend to land on their side if you sprinkle and look kind of odd, and when you flatten them they have frosting on them. I confess to being a bit of a nit picker so, if you don't mind the random look with daisies landing every which way, these will do a nice job of visually filling out a cake or cupcake for a child's party or any family occasion. They look nice combined with single-colored sprinkles to emphasize a particular color from the assortment, such as pink, and this brings back the random-sprinkle look I lost when arranging the daisies how I wanted them."
419843,"'MaryLou Cheatham ""The Collard Patch""",3,"Having enjoyed the wonderful flavor for breakfast for the first time in a very long time, I decided to do some research on whether there were nuts.  (It has been a couple of years since I've eaten Honey Nut Cheerios, and I remembered nuts.)<br /><br />According to an article I read at Wikipedia,  General Mills introduced this delicious honey-and-nut flavored cereal in 1979 with almonds in it. The nuts, the article says, were discontinued in 2006.<br /><br />Now, let's take a look at the nutrional value.  Evidently we can expect the contents of this cereal to change periodically, because there is a statement to that effect on the Cheerios website.<br /><br />More or less, a small serving (3/4 cup) has 110 calories.  I don't usually want to stop at 3/4 cup of cereal.  That little serving has 9 grams sugar and 290 mg sodium.  It supplies 25% of a day's requirement of iron.  How many of us need all that iron?<br /><br />The good things included are 2 grams fiber and 50% of a day's requirement of folate, along with small amounts of vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, vitamin D, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, phosphorus, magnesium, and zinc.<br /><br />Ingredients include whole grain oats, sugar, oat bran, modified corn starch, honey brown sugar syrup, salt, canola and/or rice bran oil, and natural almond flavor.<br /><br />The box says that the product can help lower cholesterol and heart disease.<br /><br />I hope you will find this review helpful."
188638,R. Davenport,3,"The bulbs dim properly and work as advertised.  Shaped to look like a candle. Warm white instead of glare white light, which is good. The bulb has a mini-socket base and works fine in those types of lamp.  However, the adapter base that is supposed to enable their use in a standard socket doesn't fit up tight against the bulb, making it stick up 3/8"" and it looks very odd in a chandelier.  Since that was our intended use, we can't use the bulb where we would like to.  Guess the cheap price should have indicated that there was something wrong with the product.<br /><br />One other thing to consider is that the bulb is thicker than the standard candelabra bulb, so it will not work with some types of glass chimneys that are intended to slide over the light."
396660,Sound Investor,3,"The jar of curd arrived with the paper seal torn (not just torn, 1/2 inch missing - see photo above), the jar was sticky and there were sticky fingerprints on the lid. When I opened it there was no suction from a seal. It's obvious to me that this jar had been opened, used, then returned and re-sold to me; either that, or someone in shipping had a bad case of the munchies. Since it would cost me more in time and gas to return it for a refund, I'm writing this review. I'll buy the lemon curd the next time I'm in a town with a Trader Joe's. At the time of purchase the seller was Delanotradingcompany and fulfilled by Amazon. ***An Update: a few days after writing this review, I got an email from Amazon apologizing for the problem. Since the jar of curd didn't come from Amazon, they couldn't replace it, but they refunded my money. Very impressive customer service, Amazon, thank you. Since the curd itself is a good product, I'm raising my rating from one star to 3."

23103,"Julie A. Dawson ""Bards and Sages Publishing""",3,"Puroast low acid coffee does what it says it will do, allow folks with certain stomach sensitivities to enjoy coffee without hearburn.  The 3 oz packet produces a very strong pot of coffee, and therefore some folks may want to experiment with using a partial packet to brew the perfect pot.  But the coffee had a full-bodied flavor and did not leave any bitter aftertaste.  I would compare the taste to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E0TW"">Melitta European Roast Extra Dark Ground Coffee, 10.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 4)</a><br /><br />The problem is that while the coffee itself is good, it is rather overpriced.  As it stands, you are looking at spending over $2 a pot if you buy the ten-pack.  Particularly in light of the fact that some folks will waste a pack or two trying to adjust to suit their tastes.  I can buy four or five full size cans of the Melitta coffee for the price of this brand.  Because of the price, the coffee is not a good value for your buck."

Highly recommend!"
551728,C. Anderson,3,"What I like about these treats is that they are super healthy. They don't contain any grain, sugar, or similar additives (unlike so many dog treats on the market). However, like a lot of health foods they smell kinda funny (like seaweed) and I get the sense that my dog doesn't care much for them. When offered one of these treats along with her kibble or ""jerky"" treats, she forgoes these every time in favor of the other."
425369,"James ""JL""",3,"I visited some relatives this summer and was introduced to Lavazza, It's quite good. To those who don't know, some ""bitterness"" in  espressos is a desired quality to some extent.<br />For the money, I find Eight O'clock ""100% Columbian"" or ""Dark Roast"" to be quite good for a good cup of espresso, and when I want an Excellent cup, I buy ""Italian Roast"" coffee from ""The Roasterie"" in Kansas City, online. These two brands use Higer Quality 100% Arabica beans(I have NO relationship with them except as a customer)and I hardly ever find ""quakers"" in The Roasterie's coffees (quakers are unripe, underdeveloped beans that usually appear much lighter in color than fully mature coffee beans, and I ALWAYS pick through my whole beans to remove them as the inclusion of even one of these quakers will ALWAYS reduce the quality of the taste of your cup of coffee. More expensive brands of coffee almost always have a significantly reduced number of these quakers.) Lavazza uses a combination of Arabica and Robusta beans. The Robusta beans, in my humble opinion, don't taste as good as Arabica beans, but have, on average, almost twice the caffeine content as Arabica beans, so generally you'll get a much stronger ""jolt"" if you drink coffees made with Robusta beans. I'll stop my rambling here!<br />Cheers,<br />JL"

When you have cheated on your diet and have eaten gluten, this is a wonderful satisfying snack for when you are back on track eating properly.

364057,"Michael Demeritt ""2bz2p""",3,"Since there were six bars in this review package I gave half of them to the front office where I work and asked what they thought. A surprising number -- more than half -- said things like ""Icky"", ""Too Bitter for Semi-Sweet"", ""Weird after taste"".  Some thought it was OK, but not great. But the very few who liked it (including me) liked it a lot.  It has a strong chocolate taste, but is far more bitter than most 62% Cacao dark bars.  It has a waxy quality, but seems all natural when you read the ingredient list. It also appears to be lower calorie than other bars of the same Cacao content.  Bottom line is this - you can beat the price and taste at Trader Joes, so for most it's not worth going out of your way for, but the unique blend of flavors will make it something you are unlikely to be ambivilant about. You'll either love it or hate it, so try it and see where you fall. If you do not like true chocolate flavor (in other words, you prefer Cacao butter and cream, milk chocolate, over dark) don't bother with this. If you do, this bar is more bitter than sweet."
318622,D. Money,3,"When I first tried these, I loved them, but I started to get tired of them. They're very simple--basically just sesame seeds and date syrup, which is what I liked about them at first. I love sesame seeds, but I think I decided that they're just a little to sweet for my taste. I'd definitely give them a try--it's a nice snack occasionally."

There were no ingredients on the product details page but I assumed since it was a vegetable dish it would be okay. My son is not specifically allergic but I don't like to give it to him as he spits up more. So, I'll likely not be getting it again. Also, it's extremely bland and not as good as the fresh stuff I make. But in a bind, it's a good meal I guess."

241012,"Douglas B. Moran ""Computer+History/Politics+D...",3,"The box says ""crunchy oat cereal with just a hint of CINNAMON"", but I would classify it has having a moderate cinnamon taste, which is a reasonable level for this type of product. I would have been disappointed if there was less. The problem is that here cinnamon is the predominant taste -- the underlying squares are quite bland.  In most recipes, cinnamon functions as an accent, and for good reason. Without a base flavor, the impact of the cinnamon is fleeting and unsatisfying.<br /><br />Although the box claims that the cinnamon is ""baked into"" the squares, a very noticeable amount winds up in the milk and on the side of the bowl (as specks), which is more what I would expect from it being a coating.<br /><br />The squares are definitely crunchy and stand up well to sitting in milk.<br /><br />3-stars = ""It's OK"" : I wouldn't buy it for myself, but I wouldn't refuse it if someone else served it to me."
325625,"Kevin Nicholls ""jaded, aging hipster""",3,"I grew up with Kool Aid, during an era where you were never more than a few minutes from Kool Aid Man busting through walls during after-school / Saturday morning cartoons. A generation that can identify two-quart containers from twenty paces.<br /><br />So, what's up with this <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002WWHXS6"">Tang</a> container claiming to be Kool-Aid? And Peach Mango?<br /><br />Well, in terms of convenience, this kind of Kool Aid is the wave of the future, compared to mixing scads of sugar with a packet of Kool Aid in a two-quart container. Like Tang, it mixes really easy, and it doesn't separate unless you leave a mixed cup of it out for a long time.<br /><br />In terms of flavor, though... I don't know if it's the sweetener that Kool Aid is using in this product, but it tastes a lot like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003XOMHV0"">Crystal Light On The Go Metabolism Plus Green Tea Peach Mango</a> (without the flecks of green tea). It's got kind of a diet taste to it, and upping the amount of powder you use just makes it sweeter, rather than having a more robust flavor. Even Tang gets more orange if you add more powder!<br /><br />Kool Aid Man isn't busting through anything over this flavor, that's for sure."
479090,"Norfeest ""Yes Yes Y'all""",3,"This stuff is great as a snack.  As a breakfast cereal?  Not so much.  For some reason, the taste totally disappears once they come in contact with skim milk and they get soggy (and extremely chewy - like chewing coconut) in less than 3 seconds.  So it's like chewing on wet cardboard with a hint of cinnamon or something.  Maybe it's just me.  Oh well, go figure.  I do love them as a great finger food.  So I recommend these as a light, healthy snack right out of the box, but if you're looking to buy this as a breakfast cereal, I recommend looking elsewhere."
302481,Lucia,3,"This is far from the dark roast coffee I prefer.  I've tried doubling the amount I use for a cup, but it still doesn't produce a rich flavor.  I wouldn't purchase again.  I wish someone would make an organic dark roast freeze-dried coffee."

I was afraid it was my new popper so decided to try it in my old Stir Crazy popper.  This time there was about 1/4 of unpopped kernels but at least a full cup of poorly popped corn (tiny, tough pieces).<br /><br />So I tried some old Orville Redenbacher's I had in the pantry in the new popper.  Almost all of it popped with only about a tablespoon of unpopped kernels.<br /><br />The flavor of the Great Northern was wonderful and what DID pop was crunchy and not at all soggy.

543648,"Nickolas X. P. Sharps ""Fleet Strike 13""",3,"Well following in the footsteps of the successful MiO comes Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink. From a practical standpoint Vitamin Squeeze has a lot going for it. All you need is some water, squirt in some Vitamin Squeeze and bada bing, you now have an energy drink. The drink additive boasts zero calories, zero carbs, and zero sugar. That alone is pretty impressive coming from something labeled as an energy drink. Then of course Vitamin Squeeze is loaded with a fair share of vitamins and I suppose that could be a big benefit for the right consumer.<br /><br />On the other hand I doubt very many people who are concerned with vitamins and healthy beverages will be attracted to the Fruit Punch flavor. I can still occasionally stomach ultra-sugary Kool-Aid or Hi-C and I think that the MiO Fruit Punch is actually on of the better flavors the brand offers. Vitamin Squeeze Fruit Punch, however, has all the overly sweet taste of these other products with the addition of a nasty tang, probably due to the Vitamin C. At least that is what I'm guessing the bad after taste comes from because I've had the same experience with other Vitamin C beverage enhancers. Either way, the flavor is pretty gross.<br /><br />The other thing about Vitamin Squeeze you need to take into account is the fact that it is far less versatile than MiO or even just bottled drinks. You have to carry around the large, 12-ounce container PLUS whatever you are flavoring with it. It's just not mobile really.<br /><br />***EDIT***<br />I added a third star because I my little brother drinks this stuff all the time and he actually enjoys it."

I appreciate the fact that these are built with nutrition in mind, but since my dog ONLY eats healthy dog food I'm not entirely concerned about a small, fun snack for him from time to time.<br /><br />At the sound of me saying ""treat!"" my dog almost looses his mind.  When I first gave him this he took it in his mouth, ran over to his treat-eating spot, and then dropped it and looked at it, not sure what to make of it.  After a while he bit into it (CRUUUUCH!) and ate the entire thing.<br /><br />I offered him another one the next day and he took it with a lot less enthusiasm than he usually does when taking treats.  It was almost as if he was saying, ""Well, if that is all I get I'll take it, but next time you say 'treat' it better be something I can get excited about.""  He ate it as well, but without the usual glee he puts into his treat-eating.<br /><br />So, he'll eat them but there are a host of other treats -- most of them also built with health in mind -- that he would prefer to eat first.  I'll still give him all of these square little biscuits from time to time but only because I don't want them to go to waste.  I won't be getting another bag."
552175,"Baldanders ""Gear junkie""",3,"Got this hoping it would be as good as the Dilmah I bought in Colombo in 2005; that version was labeled ""organic,"" though I'm not sure it was certified. That tea was very tasty with complexity; this tea is not nearly as good but it is still pretty decent, modestly flavorful but I usually use two teabags; lacking in any depth or complexity, it will probably demonstrate the predictability required of mass-produced teas. The smaller specialty teas, though often good, can be unpredictable and therefore have difficulty attracting a loyal following. This tea is packaged well, and has a decent shelf life, but it's nothing to rave about.<br /><br />I would warn readers that make it down this far in the list of reviews that several of the other reviews appear to be from customers with single reviews only (thus of questionable authenticity / objectivity), and the down-voting of this review (I assume by the same writers) takes it off the main page.

133394,Raven A. Wind,3,"Yes, I know. It says ""vanilla"" and you expect it to taste like vanilla. What am I complaining about? Well, I was sort of expecting it to taste a bit more like coffee with a hint of vanilla, but instead this tastes like a blend of vanilla and coffee, in that order. Some people say they barely taste the vanilla. For me, it was front-and-center. It also had a sort of acid feel in the mouth, like fake vanilla, even though it says it uses real vanilla beans.<br /><br />It's good coffee, though. Quite strong, quite potent, and well-ground, it works in any coffee maker and it doesn't take much to make a nice, strong cup of coffee. It's just not for me. I'd recommend cutting this with another plain coffee, to minimize that strange vanilla flavor.<br /><br />If you like vanilla, you'll probably like it. Me? I think I'd rather just order a mocha."

153346,Anonymous,3,"In so many ways, this is a really good jerky: low in fat from the buffalo, a nicely thick natural slab cut, slightly moist so that it has a nice bite without the toughness of leather, and a sufficiently peppery kick from a nice black pepper crust. Plus the assurance of no hormones, preservatives, or msg as shouted on the big green sticker on the package. The quality is there, no doubt.<br /><br />So what's wrong with it? It's right there, second on the list of ingredients -- SUGAR! This jerky is too sweet! I ordered the Peppered flavor and I was expecting a savory treat, a nice snack for the afternoons. Instead, this stuff is as sweet as maple syrup and not really what I wanted.<br /><br />Too bad, as I'm now stuck with 8 of these packages. For now, I'm going back to the SnackMasters brand.

452321,"Patrick C. Miller ""PCM""",3,"I've been drinking my coffee black for 30 years. I've had 100 percent Kona coffee and know how it tastes. Unfortunately, it's quite expensive and not easy to get where I live. That's why I buy Archer Farms Kona blend when I grind my own beans. It's not too pricey, yet it delivers some of that great Kona flavor.<br /><br />I looked forward to trying Tully's Kona blend in my new Keurig B60. Don't get me wrong; this coffee's good. But if there's any Kona in it, I sure can't taste it. Although Keurig's website says all Kona blend K-cups contain at least 10 percent Kona, there's nothing on the Tully's box confirming this.<br /><br />If you want a good cup of coffee, Tully's Kona Blend delivers. If you expect to actually taste any Kona coffee, don't bother."

133281,Karl,3,"This Starbucks coffee is a (very consistent) medium grind which works perfectly either in a coffee press or for drip (filter) brewing.<br /><br />The aroma from the bag and the cup is distinctly, and strongly, vanilla.  If you actually like the flavor of coffee (as I do), you will not find it here.  Starbucks states that they used a lightly roasted Latin American bean that sets off the flavor.  In my opinion, it sets it off too well, as the only flavor I could detect was the vanilla (and ""other natural flavors"").<br /><br />Sipping the coffee, it had a round, smooth taste and feel and low acidity.  The coffee press let the oils through that were trapped by the filter in the drip test cup and felt a bit oily to me, perhaps from the vegetable glycerin added to bind the unidentified ""natural flavors"".<br /><br />I grind moderately to dark roasted beans for each cup prior to brewing and actually like the flavor of coffee with (rarely) at most some subtle additional flavor.  The vanilla flavor here is neither subtle, nor completely natural if you happen to be someone who has cooked with actual vanilla beans.<br /><br />Folks who like flavored coffee will probably like this as long as they appreciate the difference between flavored coffee and coffee into which a sweet flavored syrup has been poured.  Folks I know who typically buy ground coffee for an automatic coffee maker would enjoy this."

176753,Bubbles,3,"When Trident dropped their cinnamon flavor (Robt Redford's favorite and mine), I went into sense-mourning.  After a year of pretending not to care and chewing peppermint flavored gum as a poor second choice, the 5-Flare pricey but good substitute came on the market.  YAY!  Then, gone, nada, nothing, nowhere in the San Francisco Bay Area could I find it.  I tried contacting whoever makes Trident and didn't get a response.  Researched the internet and found that cinnamon trees have a disease from time to time and it becomes rare, and thus difficult to produce.  To top it off, I read the flavor of cinnamon was a favorite of oldsters.  Hm, I'm over 65 and therefore potentially in a dwindling market (all our false teeth and arthritic jaws?).  However, I fell upon the Flare gum in a Pennsylvania store off the beaten track so I knew it continued to exist.  Now I'm on the internet and buying it through Amazon.  Bless you kiddos.<br /><br />P.S.  Two months after the above review....I think I cried ""huzzah"" too soon.  Almost every box I opened from this shipment from this purveyor (and I bought several multi-packs at one time), from the beginning of their tenure in my cool storage closet, had at least four sticks stuck together (each individually wrapped, yet still stuck to each other).  I checked, and Wrigley's is still making this flavor, so I don't know why they were glued together, making them unusable.<br /><br />I was told that the perfume sold in perfume ""stores"" in shopping malls are made up of mostly old product (thus the scent won't be ""true"").  I'm wondering if the same thing is happening with these wholesale online sellers.  They buy old, degenerating product from Wrigley's and pass them onto us? For my next order, I won't go with this particular seller."

543556,Rick Lobrecht,3,"This review is based on a sample bottle provided through the Amazon Vine program.<br /><br />I drink a lot of flavored water.  From Mio, to Nuun, to Crystal Light, and the store brands, I've tried most of them.  This one sounded pretty interesting.  Upon receiving the bottle, I stuck it in my bag to take to work.  When I went to use it for the first time, I looked at the back to see how much to use.  I was quite surprised to find it needed to be refrigerated after opening.  Back home it went, where it could be refrigerated.<br /><br />I find the flavor to be good.  You can actually taste the pineapple, and maybe some banana (although there's not banana in the picture.)  Like most of these things, getting the mix can be tricky.  After a few attempts, I've figured it out.  I think I'm using more than the squirt per 8oz, but that's ok.<br /><br />I don't usually feel caffeine (unless I drink a lot) so I can't really tell if this would affect a normal person.  The price seems high, but I don't really know how much you get from 12 oz of mix, compared to a box of pre-measured powders.  If a squirt is half an ounce, this is about twice as expensive as Crystal Light.  Of course the fact that it needs refrigeration may imply that it's a little more real than its competition.<br /><br />It's good enough that I might try the other flavors."
464365,"dnetdog ""averageGuy""",3,"The Kona blend pods are okay, but a bit weak and lacking in ""bite"" like the coffees I prefer. My favorite of the pods was the Espresso Blend, which is no longer available in the US.<br /><br />I've tried using the ""coffee duck"" as a substitute for the Senseo pods... and it works okay with a good, finely ground coffee, but it's much less convenient than just tossing a pod into the coffee maker.  And the ""duck"" doesn't produce the trademark foam on the coffee surface.  Melitta Dark roast is another alternative for those who like a bit more coffee taste, but the Melitta is not as good as the Senseo Espresso Blend was (when it was still available).<br /><br />My understanding is that in the very near future, the existing US supply of Senseo pods will be exhausted and users will either need to find a replacement or move on to a different type of coffee maker... maybe a Kuerig machine or, when it's available, the new Starbucks Verisimo machine.  I believe the latter is slated to be on the market in time for the 2012 Christmas holidays.<br /><br />I hate to see the Senseo machines go... and I believe the pods and the machines are still being sold in Europe... but due to some corporate mergers and non-compete agreements, we are about to see the Senseo line come to an end in the US.

416190,Ana Logue,3,"I like the taste of this broth. As a longtime vegetarian, I cannot say how much it tastes like chicken, as I haven't had chicken in decades. I really don't care if it tastes like chicken, I just like a variety of vegetarian flavors. This flavor could be called ""yellow"" (and Frontier's beef flavored broth could be called ""brown""), it still tastes good to me. This is a quick, savory broth mix, that satisfies an urge for something hot and salty. I liked this and was going to buy more until I checked the nutritional stats. If you aren't too concerned about nutritional value, you may like it too.<br /><br />But the salt is the problem. I use about 2.66 tablespoons of broth powder (2 Tbs + 2 tsps) to make a cup of about 10 ounces of broth. It comes to 1400 mg of sodium. I am not on a low sodium diet, but I keep track, and my daily allotment of healthy sodium intake is 2300 mg (based on a 2000 calorie a day diet). So one bowl of this broth uses more than half (60%) a whole day's worth of salt!<br /><br />It also has 4 grams of sugar in the above described serving. My 10 ounce bowl has almost no other nutritional value, no vitamins, no protein, and 80 calories. For me, this is not a food that should be a pantry staple, it just isn't nutritionally worth consuming. I'd really worry about giving this regularly to anyone with high blood pressure concerns.<br /><br />This broth is good, but not so good I can't give it up for healthier choices. It could be an occasional treat, but it really isn't great enough to be a splurge food. I'd rather indulge in pizza or nachos once in a while and otherwise eat lower salt foods."

284332,My Fake Name,3,"***<br /><br />I ordered these bags of baby food in the expectation that a baby I personally know, seven-month-old Julius, would just pretty much lap them up, which would save his parents a fair amount on their food budget.  As it turns out, as the result of a long series of carefully measured, double-blind observations involving a large experimental sample size and of course a large control group, it has been ruled out that any explanation other than a constitutional aversion to spinach causes Julius to vomit.  Shortly after Julius eats spinach, he vomits.  Not just mostly but every single time.<br /><br />And I don't mean regular vomiting.  I mean what's called projectile vomiting, which you can look up, in which the vomitus can be exprelled WITHOUT WARNING at astonsihingly high rates of speed considering they're coming from a seven-month-old baby who can barely sit up yet without help.  Julius has ejected vomitus as far away as 10 feet at first burst, which is pretty impressive and a little dangerous if you happen to be leaning over him at the moment.<br /><br />As it turns out, his parents and the other people who take care of him DO have a preference whether Julius eats spinach.  Not surprisingly, they do NOT like it when their baby unexpectedly and at skin-stinging velocity pukes in their faces.  You might call them selfish to deprive him of spinach, but I don't.<br /><br />This product contains spinach in every bite, er, squoosh, so I am unable to test it in the field, on the ground, in real time going forward.  I can say that the fact no one fed Julius this product several times has saved exactly that many episodes of his unwanted projectile vomiting.  For this I add 1 star.<br /><br />However, I also did offer some of the Juicy Pear & Garden Greens version to my dog, PheyeG'hdeaux, and he refused after the first taste.  And this is a dog that will happily eat cat poop and long-dead squirrels.  For this I subtract 1 star, so we're back to 5.<br /><br />NOT A CHOKING HAZARD<br /><br />Up to a certain age, infants instinctively try not only to put things in their mouths but also to swallow them without regard to whether they are swallowable or even tasty.  Few seven-year-olds would try to swallow half a pair of dice, but Julius, at one-twelfth that age, isn't yet that smart.  If he tries to swallow an object of the wrong size and shape, it will get caught in his throat in such a way that his trachea, his breathing tube, is obstructed.  Julius will eventually exhibit gross symptoms of his respiratory distress -- his inability to breathe -- but that won't matter if no adult is looking.  If enough time goes by his brain will suffer anoxia, if enough more time goes by some of the neurons as well as other cells in that brain will perish, and if enough more time goes by Julius will be rendered unconcsious, and if the ultimate amount of time goes by he will die of asphyxiation.<br /><br />So it's important that the cap for this product not be swallowable by anyone with tastes as undiscriminating and survival instincts as undeveloped as seven-month old Julius's.  If it were the cap to the valve stem of the left front tire of your car, that would be one thing, or any of the other four tires, because the likelihood that cap will be reachable by your version of Julius is so low.  But the likelihood the cap to a pouch of baby food will be reachable by an infant is much higher.  The manufacturer has chosen a design for the cap that makes it all but impossible for Julius to swallow it or otherwise be harmed by it.  In fact, you may safely dip this cap in honey and dust it with sugar and hand it to him and walk away.  Or her.<br /><br />First, it's way too big for even an adult to swallow.  I took the opportunity of being in the same room with a pouch of this product and the family's well-known big-mouth.  I asked her to determine whether she could swallow it, and after explaining my reason I watched as she tried really hard for ten seconds or so and deemed it ""Not possible.""  The collar at its widest measures 1.257 inches.  The height is 0.628 inches, which as you probably know is equal to 0.009373 smoots.<br /><br />Second, the collar that surrounds the threaded part is mostly air, i.e., except for these four thin ribs or vanes, the collar is floating outside the threaded part, which means if the infant does manage to get it wedged at the top of the trachea where it enters the mouth, not only can air still pass through but any of the baby food itself can pass through.<br /><br />NOT NOT ORGANIC<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is a product that's referred to as organic.  The main ingredients -- pear, broccoli and spinach -- are ""organic,"" and it contains no preservatives unless you count ascorbic acid and organic lemon juice.  The problem, of course, is that without preservatives the product is more likely to spoil, to go bad.  And going on the assumption that foods labelled organic are more expensive to get from soil to spoon, the price of this product is surely higher than it would be otherwise.  For its being organic I subtract 1 star.<br /><br />EXTRA TESTING<br /><br />-- The goop, while it might be perfectly healthful for a baby, is a perfectly dreadful substitute for taco sauce, salad dressing, or the Alfredo sauce on a Parmesan-besprinkled bed of liguine.  Trust me.<br /><br />-- You might be wondering how well the goop inside, which does taste like pear and even kind of has the grit of pear, works as a substitute for, say, floor-tile mastic.  I laid four one-foot linoleum tiles in a quarter-inch bed of Baby Gourmet 1 Simple Purees 6 Months+ Organic Juicy Pear & Garden Greens, 4.5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12) and waited a whole 24 hours, at the end of which time the tiles were not even remotely well-stuck to the subfloor but did attract a LOT of ants, so many that we needed the services of a professional exterminator, for which we will be suing Baby Gourmet for an amount in excess of $25,000.<br /><br />-- When you fire a Marlin .22 caliber rifle at the pouch from ten yards away, the bullet passes through quite readily and embeds itself in the right door of the 2012 Hyundai Sonata that is parked in the driveway of your neighbor three houses west, who will start out incredulous and end up irate.<br /><br />For these defects I subtract no stars, I just thought you should know.<br /><br />PRODUCT DESCRIPTION<br /><br />Finally, the Product Description on Amazon is comical.  It starts this way:<br /><br />""We think every mom has a morbid fear of feeding their babies vegetables . . .""  First, I find it sad that whoever wrote this decicded to say ""their babies"" when it should have been ""her babies.""  One thing we know for sure about anyone who's a mom is that that person is a female, so the excessive political correctness of not using the gender-specific pronoun here is also comical.<br /><br />But second, and more important, I find it incredible that the people at Baby Gourmet really believe ""every mom has a morbid fear"" of feeding vegetables to her baby.  Not just some moms, not just many moms, not even most moms, but EVERY mom.  That's just stupidly wrong.  And it's even wronger when you remember that it's a MORBID fear, one that is on a par with fearing death itself.  Whoever wrote this is telling us that the people at Baby Gourmet sincerely do believe that EVERY mom has a MORBID fear of feeding vegetables to her baby.  This is insultingly false, and it gives you permission to question everything else they say.  This is an example of offering for sale a solution to a problem that doesn't exist till the marketers create it.<br /><br />Also, I have to point out that the description goes on to say ""thus we have made a blend of Organic Pears, Organic Broccoli and Organic Spinach that taste well, out of this world actually!""<br /><br />For the comical mistakes in the Product Description I subtract no stars.

When I received the product I learned it contained whole eggs and garlic in the formula.  My dog is on a low-fat Vegetarian diet to control her cholesterol levels and allergies <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000634HD2"">Natural Balance Vegetarian Formula Dog Food, 28-Pound Bag</a>.  I thought of adding this mix-in to make her meals more palatable.  While Sojos is a tasty and natural mix-in that helps my little carnivore miss her meat less, I was disappointed to learn that it has these ingredients in it:<br />1- EGG - is highly allergenic. My dog is allergic to poultry and since this is a poultry product, I'd rather not have this in the formula.<br />2- GARLIC - published as a substance that is toxic to dogs.  My references:  both the ASPCA web site, and the book <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0813819857"">Blackwell's Five-Minute Veterinary Consult Clinical Companion: Small Animal Toxicology</a>.  I am including a very short excerpt from the book, ""The Allium species of plants belongs to the Alliacae family and includes onions, garlic, chives, and leeks.  These plants contain propyl disulfides and can cause Heinz body anemia when ingested by companion animals.  Cooking, drying, processing, and spoiling do not negate the toxic effect.  Pets on diets with Allium supplementation (e.g. garlic or onion powder) may be chronically poisoned.""  Detailed info on pages 457-460.  When I learned this, I quickly stopped feeding my dog this product.  This didn't come cheap and that also adds to my disappointment because now it will have to be thrown out.<br /><br />If the manufacturer changes the formula and removes those two ingredients, I might consider buying this product again."
127339,"Addison Dewitt ""I'm nobody's fool.""",3,"Upon opening the single packet, I smelled something that did not smell like coffee. Because I'm a polite person, I can't actually say what I smelled. Let's just say that it would be an odor one might come in contact with near a water treatment plant or a paper mill.<br /><br />After reading several reviews here before making coffee with the product, I decided to use a microwave to brew it. I put a cup of water in a large cup, put in the pod, put the microwave on high for 5 minutes (which usually boils water at 4) and pushed the start button. This means that I actually brewed the coffee for longer than recommended at higher water temperatures than a single-pod machine would use.<br /><br />The result after this method was STILL a weak cup of coffee. When I added soy and stevia, it actually tasted more like warm soy milk than anything.<br /><br />I will use the rest of the box, but only as back-up when I run out of my regular single-cup bags. Sorry, not really a coffee product I would buy."

It comes in a box that opens easily and it feels like a nice assortment to receive as a gift. Though I agree with others that it could use something else - a sweet or something to make it more special than just beans/grains and flavorings.<br /><br />It comes with several recipe cards.  I also liked this idea, that the recipient can use the ingredients to make something right away (though some fresh veggies are needed in addition to what is in the box).<br /><br />I tried one recipe - the quinoa sweet potato cakes, and wasn't impressed. The amount of chili powder called for made them so spicy I could barely eat them. I definitely couldn't serve them to my kids.  Even with less chili powder, I think they would have been just mediocre.  None of the other recipes looked appealing to me.<br /><br />So now I just have a few bags of beans and flavorings waiting for another use.<br /><br />I'd give this product a good rating for the packaging and the concept.

56143,"Marshall B. Kerr ""Taking rinky dink to levels...",3,"Okay, it is a good rice. Tilda Basmati is a completely fantastic rice if separate rice grains are an important thing to you.<br /><br />I should say that I purchased a Zojirushi NS-LAC05 rice cooker. If you want rice to make a difference, buy a really good rice cooker. Rice does not have to be a filler substance.<br /><br />Tilda Basmati Rice has extra-super long grains. The grains are so long that many of them curl after being prepared. This is an absolutely superb rice if a fluffy, separate grain rice is of high priority. There is a place for that and I am quite thankful for my purchase for that category of need. Tilda really is a great, high quality rice for common rice needs.<br /><br />Since I got my Zojirushi rice cooker, well, the cooker really brings out the differences in rice. If you just prepare your rice in a saucepan on the stove, it really doesn't matter all that much to buy an upper level quality rice IMHO. No offense to saucepan/stove-top people. Rice is a good and often necessary food item. Stove-top prep is certainly better than not having it. HOWEVER, my Zojirushi rice cooker has really made rice a whole 'nuther deal.<br /><br />And to my point: Tilda Basmati is a really great rice if you want fluffy rice with separate rice grains. Fluffy rice with separate grains is a totally valid category. In fact, it may be what most people want. I feel that my Tilda Basmati is a very high quality rice. My only disappointment is that it is in that extra long grain category and the fact that it produces very separate rice grains, which could be a very positive aspect to many, if not most. I just happen to like rice that sticks together more.<br /><br />I would buy it again in a heartbeat next time I need long grain rice that has very separate grains. Since I purchased a 10-Pound bag, I may not need to buy more for a while.<br /><br />Very highly recommended if you want fluffy rice with separate grains. Not much good for sushi rice."
517734,Ghost(Ghost(M)),3,"This substance is quite a bit like Vegemite (one reviewer here makes a point that it's not: I'm not sure he tasted both, otherwise why make such an obviously absurd statement? Vegemite is a tad smoother, but that's all).<br /><br />The consistency and colour are a bit like chocolate mousse but much thicker. It is a bit softer than Vegemite though. The predominant flavour is salty, with a noticeable aftertaste of bitter, and a hint of smoke and beer. Ignore the promotions that suggest it's a spread: it is most certainly not a spread -- if you spread it on a slice of bread like jam or butter, you'll vomit: it's too bitter in such a huge quantity. Better do this: spread some nice butter on your bread, generous amount, and then add no more than quarter teaspoon of this thing. You don't have to spread it: me, I just scoop it from the bottle and eat. Take a bite out of your bread, and then 1/4 tsp of Marmite directly off the spoon. Or you can try to spread it, but it's thicker than butter and it'll be hard to smother it evenly over butter, it'll clump and remain in one place (too much of it). A small amount does it, don't gorge, it's a strong flavour. It also works great with zesty greens, like arugula, for example. Well, there isn't much else to say: it's great stuff, and I can heartily recommend it.<br /><br />Don't listen too much to the talk of its being an ""acquired taste"", only for the Brits, etc. It's a normal condiment that all people will like, I believe. Which brings me to one very significant moment: it's absurdly overpriced. I would put it in the same category as, say, soy sauce, or salsa, and it should cost about the same too.<br /><br />Btw, don't get it here, get it locally: it's a bit more expensive but there's no shipping, so the overall cost will be much lower. I get it in Whole Foods, for the obscene seven/forty-nine a small jar (but it's less than overall here though), or, when they have it (not always), at Wegman's, for the less-unreasonable four/ninety-nine. Good stuff, but needs to be much cheaper, when will Unilever come to their senses? I think a fair price for Marmite would be like, say, three dollars for 250 grams (and it shouldn't be sold in such small jars either: 250 grams is the smallest that'd make sense, 'cause like it is, I finish it off, alone, in less than two days and have to go buy another jar). In my view, Marmite should come in 250 gram, half a kilo, and a kilo packages -- and cost a fraction of what it costs right now. It's even more expensive than Vegemite (who is available at Wegman's, for about six bucks at the time of posting). These two similar products are quite agreeable, but six to eight bucks a tiny jar is way too much, it's an insolence really. I can't give good rating to this product in view of these prices, therefore: product itself is five stars; prices one star: our overall rating here is therefore three stars."

I was expecting an intense chocolate+almond taste, but didn't get it. There wasn't much of either.<br /><br />I tried sucking off the cocoa, but the naked almond was not particularly satisfying. A ""good"" almond, but not a great one.<br /><br />Almonds have a relatively delicate taste that (for me) is best appreciated without any enhancement. (I never cared for Jordan almonds.)

After about a week of having one each morning and taking a few into work for light ""on the go"" snacks, I grew to like them. Chewy, decent (but not overpowering) fruit flavor and filling. That is when I decided I might buy some of these to incorporate into my breakfast routine.<br /><br />After seeing the price, I can confidently say that as good as these bars are, I will not be buying them. They are simply overpriced. The taste is decent (though I agree with another reviewer that there is way more fig than strawberry), the taste is not outstanding or significantly better than the run-of-the-mill breakfast bars at your local grocery (the kind which are half as expensive). As each bar is 160 calories and 1.7 ounces, the bars are simply too small to pay the per-bar price (do the math and I think you'll agree; better yet, calculate a per-ounce price with 12 bars per package and you'll REALLY see what I mean). Yes, these are 'vegan' bars but unless you are vegan (I am not) and cannot find a lower-priced alternative, I'd say that these bars are priced higher than they are worth.<br /><br />Again, I am not saying that these aren't good bars. They have a nice chewy texture, are decently sweet without being sugary, and are a filling quick breakfast or mid-afternoon snack. I simply think it is a shame that they are priced so high. If they were priced lower, I'd have given these five stars."

We can't believe how good it is.  Actual big chunks of flavorful tuna accentuated by the subtle, yet present, flavor of the olive oil.  Unbelievably good, but simply much, much too salty!  The saltiness hits your tongue after the exquisite taste of the tuna/olive oil and drowns out that taste.  What was Chicken of the Sea thinking???  Why would they try to ruin an exceptionally excellent product with far too much salt?  Frankly, we are disgusted with the amount of salt the food industry tries to force upon us instead of allowing us to savor the true taste of our food.  (As you know, too much salt is bad for your health, as well.)  This quality product does not deserve to be drowned in salt.  The pop-top cans on this 3-ounce size are a little hard to open, but the nice thing is that there are NO sharp edges left on top or can after opening (unlike most of this style top).  This size serving is a nice addition to a lunch box or to top a salad or rice with.  If you don't mind the salt, this is one excellent product.  We will buy this again, but not in the quantities we would, if it were less salty.  We want to limit our salt intake and this product would be, oh so much, better with less of it.

Different from many chipotle sauces, Taco Bell's has a stronger tomato flavor. It is very true to the chipotle sauce used in their products.<br /><br />I didn't really care to have this sauce on my tacos or burritos. It does make an interesting seasoning for tamale and enchilada casseroles. I also added a little mayonnaise and made salad dressing.

Would also not buy this as a gift for someone else without having it shipped directly to me first so I can package it in something other than the plain box it came in."
389244,Kev72,3,I have had better and I have had worse iced vanilla coffee. The 2 star deduction is because the vanilla they use is not my favorite and the coffee is not strong enough for me.
140517,Lindsey Johnson,3,"The title of this item says ""8-Count Boxes (Pack of 12)"". However, in the Product Features description, it says ""Pack of twelve, 10-count boxes each."" The picture of the item shows that there are 10 bars in the box as well. I just received my order, and the boxes only have 8 bars each. I am very disappointed because I thought I would be getting 10 bars. This isn't as good a value - I can get a better deal with coupons in the grocery store."
188491,Jose,3,The retail store ritz taste better. The price is affordable but the crackers them selves diddn't taste as fresh as the retail store ones.
369626,Jess B,3,"The rock candy did not come in nice long pretty strands as shown in the picture. It's more like candy on bits and pieces of string. It's in a bag, and then shipped in a box with no padding at all. By the time it got to me it looked like it had been beaten up pretty badly. There were many pieces still in tact, but it resembled dirty rainbow colored rock salt. Too expensive for what I got, in my opinion.<br /><br />I ordered 2 packages of this candy to take to a 4th of July party. The package arrived too late, despite my 2-day shipping. It wouldn't have mattered if it got to me on time, however, because I would have been embarrassed to give this to the hosts of the party for the guests.<br /><br />It did taste great so it did not go to waste, thus the 3 stars rather than 1."
426273,Dakota Lynx,3,"this syrup is good, must be shaken for long time to get mixed.  going to try making my own from coconut milk sugar and heat.<br />quite expensive for amt of syrup.  seems to need cutting with some sugar free maple.  mild but thin enough to cut thru this thick coconut syrup.  its OK, but not largely impressed."
175317,N. Folsom,3,"My Jack Russell terrier mix loved this treat. More than life itself. He had it out of the ball in no time flat, so that wasn't much of a puzzle. But the treat is like crack for dogs. It's the only thing he's guarded. He's never growled when his dinner or a juicy beef bone is approached. He'd leave either for a chance for some lap time. But not with this treat.<br /><br />So...I would be wary. I'm just hoping it won't make him guard other things now.<br /><br />Oh, and for the price? It seems like they could include two treats, which the ball will accommodate.<br /><br />ETA: the ball does seem to be durable, which is good."
83586,dlc92126,3,I went into this purchase with an open mind. I liked the price and thought about how nice it would be to finally get a serious French Roast for my Keurig. Unfortunately this one did not measure up in the strength of flavor dept. I may try some of their other coffees though because I liked everything else about them very much. I just need my French Roast to have more punch than this one.<br /><br />***** price<br />***** fast shipping<br />**  French Roast flavor<br /><br />Sorry guys but I'll stick with Midnight Magic and Jet Fuel for now.<br /><br />Please some show me a reasonably priced French Roast K cup that actually tastes like a French Roast.
63662,"Donna Capshaw ""Grandma""",3,"I got this because I am a huge coffee fan and am always looking for a summer drink that is cool instead of hot. I chilled the can and got myself a glass of ice. I popped the top and poured, none of that cream color for me.... I like my coffee straight. That is ALMOST what I got, they made it just a little sweet, no cream, but some sweet. I tell you, I would rather have cream than sweetener any day of the week. So, this drink did not do it for me, cold black coffee tastes better!"
42911,"McBean ""BJMcBean""",3,"I didn't find anything remarkable about this candy. It's not more tasty, it isn't smoother, and it generally just isn't any better than other dark chocolates.

267530,Northwesterner,3,"I agree with the other reviewer in that it is an acceptable sen-cha, slightly ""fishy"" and grassy.  Green Tea is our daily morning beverage, so it's fine for that, but lacks considerably when compared with other higher-end organic loose leaf green teas.<br /><br />I don't regret giving it a shot, and will gladly go through the 16oz bag I bought - but will probably look for a better organic green tea next time.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />Recession special!

The flavor is fine and I really like the product when it is in its ""correct"" condition."
49903,"Olive Harvey ""O""",3,"I was very disappointed with these bars. I wish I had not bought two boxes of these. I am generally not very picky about what I eat as far as taste goes and the ingredients all sounded good to me but somehow these bars are just not good. I hated to write a bad review for anything but I really can't eat these. I don't think I know anyone that I would even try to give them to. I tried these and the spirulina ones and both were equally unappealing. Maybe the chocolate ones might be ok, I don't know."
17708,Marlon Raghunanan,3,"Pepperidge Farm Bordeaux cookies has my vote for the best cookies on the plannet.<br /><br />Problem was in the shipping/packaging, since in the 4 packs I've opened, I can count on 2 hands the number of whole (unbroken) cookies I've gotten. Most of the cookies are in pieces as big as or smaller than a quarter.<br /><br />I'd think twice about ordering cookies via the net."
174795,Timothy Lovett,3,"The bar itself was decent and didn't have many calories associated with it. I generally try to avoid snack foods but this fact made it fairly easy for me to grab one or two of between meals.<br /><br />The taste though was semi decent and nothing special. If you don't like the taste of dates I suggest you avoid. At times it tastes like a neutrograin bar and other times it tastes like dates themselves.<br /><br />I also had, on several occasions, the unfortunate experience of getting some of the bar stuck in a tiny hole in my teeth. It's very hard to remove once it's stuck up there I can assure you.<br /><br />It's a decent bar for a quick snack but nothing too special."
61016,twinsmom,3,"I remember loving these cookies so I was super excited to get a box through Vine. I'm not sure how much the shipping packing from Amazon played into account in my disappointment or if it was all due to Nabisco. The box was pretty damaged when it got to me, dented in several places. When I opened the package, almost all of the cookies were in some state of falling apart- more so than you would expect from the damage the box showed, which is why I'm wondering if some of it came from the factory that way. May of the cookies were coming apart, the top half separated from the cookie bottom. Those that weren't in 2 pieces had the the cookie part crumbling.<br /><br />Despite their sad state, we managed to eat several cookies, holding them together when necessary. And I am sad to say that they were just ""OK"", not at all like the Mallomars I remembered from 10 or so years ago, which is probably the last time I had them. My husband agreed that they weren't quite the same. I thought the texture of the cookie was not good, it was very crumbly. The marshmallow was OK but the chocolate didn't taste all that good. Overall, they were just eh, not at all worth the calories, in my opinion. My kids will probably finish them off, though, as they seemed to enjoy them well enough."
287321,popoappache,3,"product was good. i like the way it snapped when bitten, the spice was a little hot for me. i like mine just pickled like Reser's Big Daddy sausages"
114096,Tabitha,3,"I'm not the hugest fan of the original fig Newtons so I was surprised to find that I actually liked these a little better. The texture is nice, and the little fig bits are tasty. But overall these cookies are sort of bland and not very interesting, and they leave a bit of a chemical aftertaste that is really annoying. I'd eat them if I was stuck somewhere and they were the best choice, but I would not buy them for myself."

And yes, I know that every time we go eat out or buy any type of store bought food.... that it is a gamble too.<br />But, my family considers our dogs as part of the family and this is very important too.<br /><br />Many years ago I did research to find the best priced grain free. no dye or by product food.<br />I found that some of Diamond Pet Foods had the first ingredient as being the actual real meat.<br />Plus,the grain free food made my baby girl look so healthy and shiny.<br />Also,since it had no fillers and quality ingredients it actually made her stool smaller and less stinky.<br />She has less allergies and it stopped most of her constant itching/biting/licking at her paws and less tear stains.<br />She actually loved the product, by the same maker, named ""Taste Of The Wild"" in Bison the most.<br /><br />But,I am saddened now because Diamond Dog Food has now been RECALLED for ""SALMONELLA CONTAMINATION""<br />This company makes various products that have been recalled.<br />Such as:<br />Diamond Naturals, Wellness, Natural Balance, Taste of The Wild, Apex, Chicken Soup Soul, Canidae, Country Value, 4Health, Natural Balance, Kirkland Signature, Natural Balance, Premium Edge, Professional and Solid Gold.<br /><br />I am saddened that we actually spend more money on these ""better than store"" dog food and they keep getting recalled!<br />So many families have unfortunately lost their fur babies babies and have spent thousands of dollars on Vet bills....when all we are trying to do is buying the ""better"" which are higher priced, dog food ingredients.<br />I am pretty thankful that I had signed up online,for emails about the latest dog food recalls last week.<br />My hubby and I was devastated to see that Diamond Dog Foods, Taste Of The Wild was on the list now.<br />I am sickened by these companies being so careless.

92234,G. Kauppila,3,"It's a decent coffee. The Fog Chaser from S.F. Bay Coffee is a better choice.  This is what people consider a ""bold"" blend.  That means it has harshness that hits you over the tongue like a hammer.  It's not smooth by any sense.  I usually enjoy my coffee black but this one is good with a flavored creamer to take the bitter edge off."

370944,Stephen Goldston,3,"I mean, a sugarless candy bar is not going to be delicious. If you have a sweet tooth as I do but have to reduce sugar intake, then try to get used to these. After a while you notice that real candy bars are way too sweet and you can actually look forward to one of these. If you're the type of person who loves soda, but can't get used to diet soda, then these are not for you."
426227,"Sadie Archer ""Sadie""",3,"First of all, I think it is amazing that there is such a thing as ""defatted cocoa"", and the product is a good idea despite the fact that it contains ""trace calories"" (check the back of the bottle).  However, this does not at all taste like chocolate in my opinion.  I couldn't really use it for dipping fruit; I couldn't use it for chocolate milk or chocolate sodas.  I have a feeling that this may work if you add it to creamy things like non-diet ice cream.  It left a weird after-taste in my mouth, and in general had a chemical taste. I will not buy this product again.  I'd rather eat normal chocolate sparingly than this stuff in larger quantities."

84948,BodyART,3,"I was dissapointed with this product's retail price.  While the bitter taste known to accomplany stevia was reduced in this product, I felt that there just wasn't enough powder to make it worth the cash compared to other non-aspartame based powdered drinks out on the market.  The usage directions are abysmal on the bottle, so I went with what most people stated here and started with a small quantity of powder.  I blended it very well using a blendy bottle, which is a 28oz bottle that contains a coiled circular spring inside that slices through the water, stirring with every shake.  While I can't comment on how well it tastes if you mix and let settle for long periods of time, I never had an issue with clumping or not having enough flavor.<br /><br />As for flavors, all I bought were pretty tasty.  I ordered cherry, orange, lemon-lime, strawberry, and grape all at once when there was a decent sale going.  this was in september 2009.<br /><br />Even though you don't need much powder to get a good taste, the company doesn't give any estimation as to how much you should use or how much a bottle makes.  With that in mind at the price its at, I find it hard to give this product more than 3 stars.  If it was four dollars I'd think it was a steal and easily give another star, as I estimate each jar will make upwards of 2-3 gallons, maybe more if used sparingly. at $9.95, sorry, I just can't.  I'm back to my old ways of using a touch of stevia from packets to sweeten my water and topping it off with whichever citrus fruits are on sale (a squeeze of lemon, lime, or orange for flavor)."
266958,Robert Morris,3,"We have a large family and opinions are sometimes sharply divided about food. Certain items that I request from the Vine program -- such as Nature Golden Honey Oat Grahams -- are shared with family members who comprise a focus group (of sorts) and once again, the reactions to these grahams was divided almost equally, hence the rating. Some thought they were tasteless and gave them a poor rating; others liked them. However nutritional they may be, their appeal will be determined almost entirely by what people think of the taste. I added up all of the scores, divided the total by the number of raters, and arrived at Three Stars, my own rating. Try them and judge for yourself."
468179,Cass,3,"My order was sold by Deeva Fulfillment Services, Inc. and fulfilled by Amazon.<br /><br />The cardamom was very roughly ground, full of threads throughout, and not very potent.

And you'll be left with some tough ""husk"" shreds in your mouth."

So, when the time came  was for her next pill, I gave her one pill pocket with the pill and a regular treat inside.  She ate it,no problem.<br />Now, I  temporary had to give her meds everyday and she is catching on. She eats the treat and spits out the pill!! I do not know what I am going to do.

Thus the Old Wessex oats cost $56.34 more per year.  The Old Wessex oats definitely taste better, no question about that.  But do I want to spend $56.34 more per year for the identical nutrition?

If there is an issue with freshness, there should be something on the seller's website to indicate that there is a risk in the slower shipping: it probably would have resulted in my purchasing a less perishable product."

But overall, the sweetness level was okay, the cookie was just meh.  I don't know it's like a cookie that was trying too hard.  We have been crumbling it up and putting it in ice cream, yogurt, mixing it in with granola.  The other problem that we have ended up having with these is that I did not know prior to purchase that the cookies had flax seed in them but not all of the seeds were finely ground, which means that well one the health benefit is lost but also the family members in my house who have diverticulitis got really ill after eating these cookies.<br /><br />I can't put my finger on what I didn't like about them.  Perhaps because the serving size is 3 cookies or thins and that is not at all satisfying as a snack and so it feels like another junk food disguised as a health food.  Taste wise they are okay.  But since they aren't really that healthy, I'd rather pop a real fig newton."

91651,SecretAsianMan,3,"UPDATE 11/17/2011:<br /><br />I'm dropping my rating to 3 stars. After months on this food with great results, our smaller cat started gradually losing the weight he'd gained when we switched to it, losing appetite, vomiting, and even refusing to eat. This prompted a trip to the vet, and as she's suggested that although EVO is very high quality food, the protein content is too high even for many cats. She did a kidney examination and checked for other signs of renal failure (thankfully none). Her feedback was that EVO is hit/miss from cat to cat, and when her clinic used to sell EVO they had many customers complaining of cats vomiting.<br /><br />It still seems to have worked wonders with my bigger fatter cat, but with the little guy it just upsets his stomach too much. I'd probably only switch to this food by a vet's recommendation.<br /><br />Original review:<br /><br />In my quest to buy more things online and save money I started looking at cat food and investigating what really makes good cat food. The two big discoveries were (I am not a vet):<br /><br />1. Cats are obligate carnivores. They are designed to essentially eat nothing but meat.<br />2. Dry cat food is often made of mostly grains in order to get the moisture level down to make them shelf stable.<br /><br />These two things are at odds with each other. A carb heavy diet is not easily processed by house cats, may not<br /><br />have enough protein, and can be tough on their kidneys. If you've read the other reviews here for this cat food, you know that it's highly recommended for cats with renal (kidney) failure, and there are some miracle stories of diabetic cats no longer needing insulin shots after changing to this food.<br /><br />The EVO dry food uses some patented process that I don't understand, but I can only imagine it involves a combination of wizards and magnets. The end result is a dry, shelf stable food that has much more protein than other dry cat foods, with fewer grains/carbohydrates.<br /><br />Both of our cats were healthy, but one was a bit on the skinny side, and the other was fat and lazy. Within weeks of changing over to this food, the fat/lazy one has noticeably more energy. His weight fluctuates a lot so it's a bit early to say if this has had an effect. The skinny one has definitely filled out and looks much healthier. He rarely begged for food before, but he does now.<br /><br />The food turned out to be more expensive than the Nutro stuff I was feeding them before, but given the immediately visible change in our cats I feel pretty comfortable saying that this food is healthier, and might extend their lives. If it prevents my fat cat from becoming diabetic, I'd say a few hundred bucks over the next ten or so years is well worth it."
203579,"Julie A. Dawson ""Bards and Sages Publishing""",3,"At over $4 for an 80 ct box, this artificial sweetener is excessively priced when compared to other brands.  Yes, it tastes perfectly fine in coffee and you can use it to add a bit of sweetness when cooking certain recipes without adding calories or leaving an aftertaste.  But I don't know if I really need to spend this sort of money to get additional antioxidants in my beverages.  And what are these antioxidants? Vitamin C and Vitamin E, at allegedly 20% the recommended dose per pack.  Two packs per cup equals 40% of your recommended vitamin C for the day.  Sounds great, huh?  Except I would have to consume 5 packs per day to get 100% the recommended dose of both vitamins, and a box of 80 packs would last 16 days.  Or, I can spend $8 on <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001F1B4N0"">Nature Made Multi-Complete with D3, Iron & Calcium, Liquid Softgels, 60-Count</a> and get 100% of all my vitamins for 60 days.  So there is no real value to the whole ""essentials"" ploy.  It won't hurt you to use this product (unless you are using 20 packs a day or more and you might be at risk of Vitamin C poisoning.)  But there is no point in paying more for the vitamins."

63565,J. B. Hoyos,3,"I'm sleep deprived because I work two jobs and, therefore, drinking coffee is a matter of survival for me.  I drink iced coffee during the hot summer months.  I jumped at the opportunity to sample the illy issimo Caff&egrave;, which is Coca-Cola's attempt to make a profit from America's sudden craving for iced coffee.  Everyone from McDonald's to IHop is selling it.  Normally, I make my own iced coffee at Panera Bread.<br /><br />  The illy issimo Caff&egrave; looks and tastes like black, bitter coffee, which I detest.  See the photographs that I have posted showing how dark it is compared to other leading espresso coffee brands such as Starbucks Doubleshot Espresso & Cream (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005W48BQE"">Starbucks Doubleshot Espresso & Cream 6.5 oz x 8 Cans</a>) and Rockstar Roasted Coffee + Energy Mocha [<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005GLRJ2K"">(Pack of 24) Rockstar Roasted Espresso Energy Drink 8 oz ea</a>].  Overall the illy issimo Caff&egrave; has less calories and fat per serving.  I posted photos depicting its nutritional value and ingredients.  However, the Starbucks tastes the best; naturally it has more fat and sugar.  On the other hand, the Rockstar gave me more energy, but it has a strange, sweet taste; the Rockstar is loaded with vitamins and minerals.  All three brands of coffee drinks are high in caffeine.<br /><br />  Starbucks doesn't have to worry about competition from Coca-Cola.  Starbucks exceptional taste, in lieu of nutritional benefits, will lure customers.  Most consumers drink iced coffee for its taste rather than its nutrition.  Furthermore, I don't understand why illy issimo Caff&egrave; has ""Do Not Shake"" on their cans.  No one else does.  I posted a photograph of a Starbucks Mocha Frappuccino Coffee Drink [<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018AIZKS"">Starbucks Coffee Frappuccino Coffee Drink Mocha, 9.5 Ounce Bottles-(pack of 12)</a>]; notice the ingredients that have settled at the bottom of the glass bottle.  I always shake my cans and bottles of coffee; the coffee may look frothy when I pour it but it has never spewed like carbonated sodas.<br /><br />  Illy issimo Caff&egrave; is only recommended for those who like their coffee black with a touch of sugar.  I believe it would be less expensive to make one's own coffee, refrigerate it until cool and then pour it over ice.  Rather than throw it away, I've brought home leftover coffee from my Sunday school class and put it in my refrigerator.  Later, when I ate dinner, I'd pour the coffee into a tall glass full of ice.  I'd add Stevia (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00430EJR8"">Sweetleaf Sweetener 70 Packets</a>) and milk until my sweet tooth was satisfied.  Speaking of Stevia, which is an all-natural sweetener with zero calories, I had to pour Stevia into my glass of illy issimo Caff&egrave; before I could finish drinking it.  I ran out of milk or I would have added some of that also.<br /><br />Joseph B. Hoyos"

I also liked that the founder, Katrina, had started her flavor expedition in Spain. I expected the flavor to be unique and exotic, much like my first bite of Haagen Daz Mayan Chocolate ice cream. The flavor was fine, but not any better than your average Fair Trade chocolate bar. I also found the squares difficult to break clean on the lines, thus leaving a huge mess of caramel all over. I would recommend this bar if you specifically needed a messy chocolate with ok flavor. I will, however, try the other flavors before giving up on Katrina and the Vosges."

After trying MANY varieties from both the pet store and the grocery store, the Alpo Chicken in Gravy is all he will eat (I can sometimes feed him the T-Bone steak flavor).  I guess it looks and tastes more like ""people food"" than the other varieties.  My only complaint is that when I received the shipment (pack of 24), almost all of the cans were dented, and a couple had dried gravy on the outside of the can.  One can leaked out - the dent was at the seal on the top.  Normally, I'm not someone who is picky about dented cans, but this was a little much.  A couple of the cans actually had a funny smell when I opened them.  So, I guess I'll go back to buying at the grocery store.  Just thought having them shipped to the house would be easier than lugging them home from the store.  Oh well....."
378605,Turtle502,3,"This tea claims to naturally energize without the jitters. I wish it did that. Although ""all natural"", it's important to note that each cup of tea contains about 80 mg of caffeine. That's enough to give me jitters in the middle of the afternoon, which is when I've been drinking this tea for about a month. I don't use any sugar, so the effect is completely a result of the tea.<br /><br />That aside, the tea does somehow relax my brain. My mind wanders constantly, and usually by 1:00 or 2:00 in the afternoon, I need something to keep me focused and keep me from getting cranky. The only way I can describe the effect this tea has on me is ""calming"". It's easier for me to focus, even though I still feel ""jittery"". One cup of this tea keeps me going through the late afternoon hours, and the ""jitters"" usually subside within one to two hours, while I remain focused for at least three or four.<br /><br />The tea has an excellent aroma. I love opening the package and just smelling the tea-bag -- the scent alone is quite calming. You can definitely smell and taste the vanilla. The spices aren't too overpowering, and I find this tea to have an excellent taste overall. It's not bitter compared to other ""all natural"" herbal teas I've had.<br /><br />Ultimately it depends how sensitive you are to caffeine, but I would recommend this tea for ocassional use."

I also knew all these things before I bought them since they are well documented in the Amazon reviews already, so I wasn't surprised by what I received.<br /><br />On the plus side, they are better tomatoes than I can buy canned in the grocery stores locally, so I'm happy enough with them, and I used reward points from my Amazon.com Visa to buy them, so they were essentially free to me.<br /><br />Would I buy them again?  Maybe.  If couldn't get any of the Strianese D.O.P. certified San Marzano tomatoes, then yes I probably would.  As I said, they are tasty and I do like them better than what I can buy locally, but they aren't the top tomato when it comes to what I can mail order."

Cool doesn't mean house temperature unless yours is 62 degrees. Otherwise, if somewhat warmer the bars become extremely sticky and are hard to remove from the celephane wrappers. Expect sticky licking-good fingers as well. Were it not for that I'd give it a 4+-star."
481505,Kitten Kisser,3,"This stuff taste so freakn' good...if you like vanilla.  It says it contains organic vanilla flavor.  I'm not exactly sure what that is.  If it was vanilla it would say organic vanilla.  Not flavor.  I'm a bit suspicious of that.  You have to watch it with the certified organic stuff, a lot of it isn't 100% organic & you are being robbed.<br />My package arrived damaged.  Seems the packer simply chucked the case of this inside another larger box & the smaller box bounced & slid around inside the larger box causing my bottles to leak.  Thankfully Amazon refunded my money.<br />Lastly, I've been looking into Agave & it may not be the safe healthy sweetener we've been lead to believe.  I am now doing my best to avoid it.  I have discovered that it is in darn near everything organic and Vegan.  Agave is highly processed to get the syrup.  Which is fructose.  It may not be safe for diabetics at all!  It is highly concentrated sweet stuff.  You can't just get syrup out of the plant.  It takes a massive process to get it.  I'm sure I'm screwing up the details a bit.  Go ahead and google it before you buy.  You might be glad you did.  I googled it because I noticed I had increased digestive problems after consuming yuccon syrup and agave.  If you are on the SCDiet agave is forbidden."

I did find it too salty the first time (800+ mg sodium per small serving!), but the second time I added the water to the mix in a separate bowl, mixed to dissolve and then poured a little of the salty water off.  I added fresh water to make up what I poured off, then added it to the browned hamburger.<br /><br />I would have given this 5 stars if it hadn't been so salty.

I tried it again and added honey, butter and about a quarter cup of water.  The result was a nice flavored, white sandwich bread...certainly better than frozen store bought breads.<br /><br />I am not sold on this product as the cost is substantially higher than other products.

413012,Anon. A. Non,3,"I do like the fact that you can just store these in a drawer at work... they need no refrigeration/freezing. So they're very convenient (that's the third star). However, they're not particularly great.<br /><br />First off, the plastic film cover is practically superglued on, so be prepared to clean up a lot of tomato sauce when you finally manage to rip the thing open. The instructions say ""ready in just 60 seconds,"" but you're really talking around 2-3 minutes. I honestly don't know where they get 60 seconds from.<br /><br />The pasta tastes like rubbery plastic, even if you add a little water before microwaving. I do like how the little sauce compartment lifts out of the main dish so you can then pour the sauce separately. Taste-wise, it's... edible. Not horrible, not great. When you don't have the time to go out for lunch or prepare your lunch before work, you'll be happy to have one of these handy containers in your office drawer, but I'm afraid it's not particularly tasty."
441924,"Shanshad ""shanachie_shadowfax""",3,"By now most sweet drink consumers are familiar with the various on the go packets of flavor powder than can be dumped into a water bottle or cup in order to provide the drinker with a cup of something more than water. Powder drink offerings do tend to have some specific drawbacks, however.  They can be messy to use, hard to mix in to your drink with out some serious stirring or shaking, and they most often are only available in single use pouches.  Onto the scene enter MIO liquid flavorings.<br /><br />These cute little palm sized containers featured a highly concentrated liquid flavoring rather than powder, and can be used multiple times, allowing the user to judge the amount of flavor in their particular beverage.  Very handy idea, I admit.  It's nice to have a liquid that mixes easily with the water, and the ability to adjust the amount is very appealing (those old powder packets always were way too sweet, and I'd try to use half of one).  This clever offering fits easily in a coat pocket or a purse and snaps shut tightly with no threat of spillage.  So, it's a great little traveler though I don't know if I'd try to take through airport security!<br /><br />Those using this should be aware that the  liquid does not squeeze out in little droplets.  I made the mistake of thinking it might and held the darn thing sideways instead of upside down.  The sudden, if brief stream of highly concentrated flavor made a bit of a mess to clean up.  My goof, but something to be aware of.  Turn the container upside down and be prepared for it to squirt rather than spout droplets.<br /><br />My biggest complaint, to be honest, is the resulting drink.  I don't know if it's just the sweet tea flavor type, but the drink has a distinctively chemical smell afterwards, and I am fairly sensitive to smells.  The taste itself was about what I'd expect from an added flavor, no calorie substance.  If you don't mind most of the powdered drink additions, this probably won't bother you.  However, those whose tastebuds are more accustomed to home brewed sweet tea may find it more than a little disappointing.<br /><br />Overall, the design is clever and practical.  The execution takes some figuring out, but is perfectly workable.  The taste and smell results are still problematic.  It may be that another flavor would be more to my taste and without the strong smell, but for now I'll stick to making my own sweet tea!<br /><br />Happy drinking ^_^ Shanshad"

194529,alli_g,3,"First of all, I believe taste in coffee is very individual, just like taste in chocolate.  Some prefer milk, some prefer dark.  When it comes to coffee, I prefer a good French roast.  I didn't have high hopes for a flavored instant coffee drink, and the best I can say about Maxwell House International Latte in Peppermint Mocha flavor is that it's drinkable.  In my opinion, it is too light on coffee flavor and much too heavy on the peppermint.  It's actually more like a hot chocolate drink than a latte.  There's a decent amount of foam after mixing in the hot water.  I added a bit of milk but did not need sugar as this was plenty sweet for me.  I'll keep it around to offer guests who might like this sort of thing, but it doesn't at all compare to a real latte."

50314,Hi from WA,3,"I ordered this cake mix because it has less chemicals and especially for the lack of partially hydrogenated oils.  The reviews were very good and there was a coupon available so I thought I'd give it a shot.  Unfortunately, the cake is a little dry and the flavor is not as strong with chocolate flavor as I would like either.  I have baked it twice now...once as cupcakes and as a cake and the second time I even changed the milk to whole milk and used coffee for half of the liquid. It didn't seem to make much of a difference. It's definitely better than having no chocolate cake, but the flavor of Duncan Hines is more in line with what I'd like to taste. So, after I use the mixes (think I'll try to do less time than recommended for increased mositure)I am going to try and perfect a handmade version.  I had the VERY best chocolate cake at a cafe far from my home a couple of years ago and ever since I just can't get over it.  I hope to some day get close.<br /><br />If less chemicals and more convenience is essential for you, I think this is a good option. Just don't expect it to taste like the normal cake mixes."

29551,Steve,3,"My wife and I take movies and popcorn very seriously. Every Friday and Saturday night, after the kids are in bed, we turn out the lights, pop in a blu-ray, and sit down to a movie with popcorn and soda. For about a year or so we had been buying fresh popcorn locally, but the shop had closed down and we searched for a replacement on Amazon. We knew we wouldn't find popcorn as fresh, but we were mostly concerned with flavor. We bought a box of Great Northern popcorn.<br /><br />The box arrived and I was a bit concerned with the look of the oil in the packets... it didn't look like oil at all, but rather butter after you melt a solid stick and it cools and coagulates back into a solid. It was more yellow then orange, had a curdled/marbled look to it, and felt a bit stiff. I looked all over the packaging to find an expiration date, but there wasn't any. I checked the reviews and saw that people had said it was suppose to be solid, so I went ahead and tried it. Once the oil started heating up, it melted instantly, so everything seemed ok. Although the flavor was really good, the popcorn certainly wasn't very fresh. We figured that we were so use to the fresh local popcorn that we were being too overly critical of it, so we continued to make it every weekend.<br /><br />When we were almost out of popcorn packs, we bought Orville Reddenbacher popcorn and popcorn oil at the grocery store. The popcorn was MUCH fresher, but didn't taste anywhere near as good, so we bought another case of Great Northern from Amazon. This second case was completely different from the first. The oil in the packs was orange and actually looked like solidified popcorn oil. It was also much softer, almost like a gel. We popped a pack that night and was shocked at how much better it was... the popcorn was much fresher and simply fantastic.<br /><br />A few days later I found that a friend of ours had bought a box of Great Northern from another website and stopped eating it after the third pack. He said it was stale and not very enjoyable. I gave him a pack of ours and he loved it, so he's going to return the box he got and hope to get a fresher one.<br /><br />It's a shame that there aren't better quality controls with this popcorn... a simple expiration date on the outside of the case would assure that everyone gets a reasonably fresh supply. I added an image above to show the difference between a pack in our first box (old) and one from our second box (fresh). If you get an old case, I highly recommend returning it and getting a fresher case... it'll be the difference between getting a good bowl of popcorn and a Great one.<br /><br />If I had never bought a second case, I would have rated this 3 stars. The second case was definitely a 5-star rating, but due to the inability to tell how fresh the product is until you actually open it, I can't give it more then 3 stars. This is not Amazon's fault since they would have to open the boxes and have someone judge how good it looks prior to shipping. This is a pretty big issue since if it weren't for me, my friend would have tossed his case in the garbage and would have written Great Northern off as a low-quality brand."
313965,Karla Cook,3,"My family likes Taco Bell and we like this Spicy Ranchero Sauce okay. We eat Mexican-ish style dishes quite a bit at home, so it's nice to have a bottled sauce for a little extra kick. My daughter especially liked the flavor in this particular sauce, but of course, not everyone has the same tastes. I also liked that it comes in a squeeze bottle with a flip lid with a small hole, rather than having to try to pour it out of the larger opening. That makes it convenient for adding just the amount you want. It can be used as a salad dressing, if you like thick dressings... or as a dipping sauce for tortilla chips, or on tacos, burritos, what-have-you."

Calories are not to be ignored either. The taste was OK, but not fantastic by any means - very sugary, not enough carbonation. In fact, the Kiwi Berry flavor did remind me of Red Bull as well, which I do not particularly enjoy. I think I'll stick to unsweetened iced tea..."

310638,E. Kerby,3,"I don't expect my breakfast cereal to be sugary.  I didn't grow up eating Sugary Sugar-sugars for breakfast and, frankly, very sweet cereals have little appeal to me.  Even so, this cereal is pretty disgusting.<br /><br />I bought it because I wanted to include more fiber in my diet, to keep things running a little smoother, if you know what I mean.  I've bought a couple other fiber cereals lately, but I happened to be at a grocery store that carried this one--which I hadn't seen before--so I decided to try it out.<br /><br />I do like the short ingredient list; that's great.  However, this cereal has so little flavor that it is almost inedible.  I have eaten it with berries a couple times, and that really improves the flavor.  On the box it calls the shapes ""Crunchy O's"", and the picture makes the cereal look like long, grainy Cheerios.  The actual product does not look like that.  The actual product looks like little logs.  It looks like hamster food, so that is what my husband and I call it.  (""I'm going to have some hamster food.  Want some?"" or ""I'm ready for breakfast.  Do you want me to grab your hamster food?"")<br /><br />One other thing is, I wouldn't really expect this cereal to be delicious, but the box is pretty misleading about that.  On the back of the box it calls it ""tasty""--twice!  It also says the cereal ""is the healthiest, most effective and enjoyable Fiber cereal you can buy.""  Healthiest?  Maybe.  Effective, eh, okay.  Enjoyable?  Nope; I have to draw the line there.  And then, the back of the box has a series of testimonials including: ""It's the best"" and it ""tastes terrific.""  Terrific?  Really?  What does that guy usually eat?<br /><br />So, if you're in the market for a fiber cereal and you absolutely cannot possibly tolerate a gram of sugar or some salt, this is probably the stuff for you.  I don't know whether they used food-grade inks to print the box, but if so, you can eat the box once you finish the cereal.<br /><br />If you would like a high fiber cereal that also has some flavor, try another brand.  I think the other one I was eating had 11g of fiber instead of 14g, but my point is that there are great alternatives out there.<br /><br />Or, plan to eat this with some fresh berries like the picture shows.  Since the cereal itself has so little flavor, the berries make a big difference."

For my taste I more than likely will use the remaining product as an added flavor boost to my regular coffee when I am in the mood for peppermint.

The texture of the noodles was slightly mushier, so I'd recommend undercooking them a bit if you want them to be more like the regular noodles. I also thought the sauce seemed more bland, not sure why that was. Since I only rarely each box macaroni and cheese, and since I did like this veggie-containing alternative a bit less, I'd probably just rather stick to the regular Kraft mac and cheese."

I am disappointed that at the taste of the chocolate and that are are so many pieces, which I assume is because of the weight of them.  A box of regular Special K that has the same weight is considerably larger than this box because the heavy chocolate takes up so little space.  Even if the chocolate were great tasting, the chocolate pieces to flake ratio is way off.  I might purchase them again, but only if I find them on sale for a great price.

I felt the only difference between the two was that the centipede ones had little legs and some were different colors but in all that was about it really.  It's not bad or bad tasting candy but it just felt like why bother getting this when I can get the same thing with a 5lb bag of regular gummi worms at the candy store nearby....."
6885,Alan Holyoak,3,"""Switch `Orange Tangerine'"" is advertized as 100% juice with carbonation.  They were accurate as far as the 100% juice and (light) carbonation goes, but imagine my disappointment when I checked the ingredients, and I read the following: ""100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, tangerine, orange, and acerola juice concentrates)...<br /><br />BTW - acerola is also known by the common names Barbados cherry and wild crapemyrtle. It's a berry that has extremely high amounts of Vit C.<br /><br />Anyway, back to the drink.  When I ordered this item I was expecting a carbonated ""orange tangerine"" drink, but that was not the taste I got.  After all, tangerine and orange are present in smaller amounts than grape and apple juices.  As a result this drink had a flavor more like a mixture of sparkling grape and sparking apple combined, with somewhat of a light citrus twist, but less carbonation than either sparkling grape or sparkling apple have.<br /><br />The overall flavor of ""Switch"" was all right, but it was not, in my opinion ""orange tangerine"" at all.  In that respect this drink was a great disappointment.  The manufacturer would have been more accurate to name this drink ""fruit punch"" or ""fruit cocktail"" or perhaps ""grape-apple"".  There is, by the way, already a ""fruit punch"" version...I wonder what's in that flavor that's not in this one?<br /><br />The can size is just adequate at 8.3 oz, but is, I would say, fairly expensive at nearly $1/can, especially when it's not what you thought you were getting.<br /><br />The drink does, to its credit, have 100% of the recommended daily amount of Vit C, and has only natural juices in it.  That is probably true, but...THIS IS NOT A DIET DRINK.  Just because the can says ""no sugar added"", that doesn't mean that there's no sugar in it.  There happens to be a significant amount of sugar in this drink (given the total volume you get/can)...if I recall correctly the contents label said 35g of sugar.  That's because 100% fruit juice is loaded with sugar, sugar like fructose.<br /><br />OK, frankly, the taste combo doesn't particularly appeal to me, that's why I didn't order the grape version of this product, and now that I know what's in the ""orange tangerine"" I wouldn't order it again.<br /><br />I'm torn between 2 and 3 stars though, simply because it's not really an orange-tangerine drink as advertized.  I guess I'll have to go with 2 stars.  (I don't know why 3 stars showed up for this product!?)  Alas..."

216857,"Totally Honest Reviewer ""barb""",3,"Quaker Oatmeal Squares have a bland taste.  A hint of brown sugar coats each square, and it is exactly that - just a hint.  According to the label, this cereal has 210 calories per 1 cup serving without milk and 250 with skim milk. It boasts 5g dietary fiber and 2g soluble fiber.  For 210 or 250 calories, I think it should have more flavor, but for those who don't like any sugar in cereal, this works out well, especially if they prefer a high-fiber one.  Personally, I wouldn't purchase these oatmeal squares and would opt for a nutritious cereal with more taste."

This works well but feels like you will break the machine with time. It really needs forcing.<br /><br />Or you can put it in the double pod holder. The problem here is it is too loose and does not seal well leaving you with weak coffee. You can moisten the pod before putting it in the machine. This does result in good coffee but is an extra step.<br /><br />Also they come individually wrapped. Perfect for a hotel or other public use, but a bit of extra waste at home.<br /><br />I won't buy again, and am looking for another pod that works with Senseo."

I have noticed that the carob powder soaks up more water and my batters are drier and denser. Still experimenting.<br /><br />I first ordered this because I have a friend who is allergic to chocolate and wanted to make them a treat.  Before I had the chance, both my husband & I had to go on a Candida diet.

7035,coffee lover,3,"I was very excited to see a product such as this being offered on line, as I loved the coffee I was drinking before I got a Keurig.  (My previous coffee is not offered in a K-cup version.)  Very promptly I placed an order and couldn't wait for it to arrive. I placed my fresh beans into my grinder and ground them a little courser than I would have if I was using my Bunn coffee pot.  I then proceeded to place the filter into the disposable K-cup, add my freshly ground beans and placed the cap on tightly.  Great!! Ready to brew my first cup of my favorite coffee.  The whole procedure worked well until the cycle was almost finished and then it happened.  Scalding hot water started squirting out of my Keurig machine from all sides.  I was trying to move my cup to catch the water, but it was coming out too fast and very hot.  I was disappointed with the performance of this product.  The coffee was good, although not a full cup and I had a mess to clean. I have tried grinding the beans finer and courser, also tried to fill the cups at different levels, but the results are still the same.  I will continue experimenting with the disposable K-cups and if I find the right combination, I will let you know."

387309,angler,3,"I have been drinking Black Cat from my super automatic for years now. I was excited to see it finally being sold on Amazon and eligible for Prime shipping. There were two things that dissapointed me... Intelligenstsia has started selling smaller bags (12 oz) for the same price that they used to sell a 16 oz bag for. I didn't play close enough attention so the savings I thought I was getting (compared to where I usually buy it) was not there. Secondly the roast date on the coffee I got was a couple months old. I am used to being a week old, maybe two worst case. These bags had been setting around for awhile. I am going to stick to getting 16 oz bags from my usual merchant."

Unfortunately, even though I tried many cups, using different water temps, (full boil, pre boil, boil and cool a bit..), and many different times to soak the tea bag, I found the tea to be weak and rather insipid tasting.  Too bad...  I had high hopes for this tea..."

But it's not nearly as good as the Green Mountain Fair Trade Organic Sumatran Reserve (Extra Bold), which have been by far the best K-cups I've tried. Timothy's has nice flavor but the body is lacking in depth and richness. It feels a bit thinner, and not quite as complexly flavored.<br /><br />Given a choice between this one and the G.M., I'd choose G.M. -- but given a choice between this one and any non-fair-trade coffee, I'd always choose this one. It's a great buy, and it is a good choice for someone who doesn't like their coffee too bold or too dark."

255072,Nir@d,3,"Despite the Lipton brand, Lipton's Green Tea tastes more like a product that a seasoned green tea drinker might enjoy, rather than a casual drinker of mass produced tea. The flavor of this green tea might turn-off a lot of casual tea drinkers who expect green tea to taste like something you might find in most bottled ice tea (and no it does not taste like Lipton's bottled Green Tea). As a hot tea green tea Lipton Green Tea has a smoky and bitter taste that might not appeal to a mass consumer green tea market, however as an iced tea the taste redeems itself as it mellows out.<br /><br />I would recommend this brand of green tea to folks who like smoky and bitter green tea. When hot the tea has a smoky aspect that is very apparent. As an iced tea you have a softer smoky taste.<br /><br />The price is actually pretty good as green tea is pretty expensive. Before investing in an Amazon 6-pack you might want to buy a single box or find someone who drinks this brand of tea to sample it."
295209,Luqman,3,"I received very good service from Amazon and fast shipping through Prime when receiving this product. However, I was not as satisfied with the syrup itself. In comparison to Torani's other sugar free syrup's, I would say that the brown sugar cinnamon variety is lacking. Whenever I use it in hot cocoa or coffee I get this strange sour and slightly bitter aftertaste. I have tried using less of the syrup to avoid this, but I then find that I can't taste the brown sugar cinnamon flavor at all. I was a bigger fan of the hazelnut sugar free syrup, which is probably what I will go back to after I finish off my supply of this flavor."
493954,"L. Lestha ""urieldewolf""",3,"Though many of our customers liked seeing some of the retro candies, the price is, I feel, outrageous.  Even if there were 200 pieces (as claimed, which I very much question), you're still talking over 22 cents PER CANDY. I know the days of penny candy are long gone but 22 cents per piece of candy is steep. Plus one of the 'candies' was actually a sizable quantity of cinnamon flavored toothpicks.  When is a toothpick considered candy?  If you count the individual toothpicks, then maybe you might hit 200 pieces (the toothpicks appear to number about 60 individual picks but they come in packages of 6 so, unless you're going to break open the package and dole them out one-at-a-time, you can't count that as 60 pieces of candy - especially when it doesn't even qualify as candy.)  An intriguing combination but not worth the cost.  I bought this assortment in mid-August and I still have quite a bit of it left because the customers have picked over what they liked and left much of the rest - including all those darn toothpicks."
136935,Riss,3,"I just made this cake and I had to spend forever mixing! (perhaps that was because I didn't soften the butter). When it came out of the oven it was a nice golden brown color and smelled good. However, it's not really a cake in my opinion. Perhaps the rice flour made it taste like cornbread, but it definitely is not sweet or fluffy enough to be a cake. I like Bob's red mill cake mix much better. However I am still on the hunt for the perfect cake mix!"
340959,Brian Chipman,3,"Planters Cashews as you should all well know are great. There is nothing wrong with Planter's well besides the price really when Emerald tends to be cheaper and taste just as good, if not better.<br /><br />Anyway, the reason I rated this 3 stars was because it arrived dented and with the foil off some of the canisters and such. I contacted Amazon about this and recieved a prompt refund and no need to return the product.<br /><br />So in the end, I can recommend you buy these cashews, but make note that Emerald is cheaper. Also these are whole cashews, but quite a few were halves and pieces.

63356,Zenpony,3,"My first choice for a coffee is never a can. I much prefer perked, homemade, hot coffee. Being of English/German background, Espresso was never a standard drink in our home. All that being said, this coffee was okay for a canned drink. There is no cream in it, so the color is dark. It is much less sweet than the Cappuccino version put out by illy, as so I liked it better than the Cappuccino.<br /><br />I did not taste the metal aftertaste in the Caffe/Espresso drink that I detected in the Cappuccino version, so that is a good thing.<br /><br />After drinking 1/2 a can straight to get the full flavor, I added a hint of half and half cream (I know, not traditional, but I'm not Italian) and I liked it better than without. This is a quick fix for a caffeine boost if you are in a hurry.<br /><br />The can is smaller than the Cappuccino, having 6.8 oz, 50 calories and 100% Natural Arabica.  One can would be more than enough for me in one day. Don't shake the can before serving."

It doesn't taste bad, but it's very bland to me. I just feel like it needs a little something extra. The pro side is that it is extremely fast & easy, just wet the chicken, throw it in a ziploc bag with the packet contents & shake it up. Once in the oven it bakes up nicely with a crispy exterior & keeps the chicken moist. I just wish it had more flavor. As for shipping, you get a clear plastic bag with 12 pouches inside. Someone else mentioned using this to flavor dishes, I could definitely see this as a crispy topping on baked mac & cheese."
75661,"John Keitz ""Islesfan""",3,"When I first opened the can, I caught a whiff of the aroma and thought something had gone bad in the can.  It was truly unappetizing.  I tried a sip anyway, and it tasted fine, so I ventured forth.  The taste is best described as a sweeter Red Bull.  The carbonation isn't overly done, so it has some fizz, but not like a soda, which is also good.<br /><br />It contains 100% daily RDA for several things, including vitamin C, but then no one drinks an energy drink to ward off the common cold.  The true test is the energy boost, and for No Fear I found little of that.  Actually, all I really got was a headache (I am not caffeine sensitive.  I don't drink energy drinks daily, but I have had them about once a week without headaches.).  I'm willing to believe that this headache was a coincidence, but I did deduct stars for the lack of energy in an energy drink.<br /><br />So, overall, bad aroma, nice taste, poor energy."
505313,Tammy S. Lyons,3,"I was very excited to try a new flavor of licorice. I am a licorice aficionado - I truly try every flavor and shape I can get a hold of and love most of it. I can't say that I was overly impressed with the flavor of this brand, though. It had somewhat of a medicinal taste. While licorice was originally intended as a medicine, I don't think it should taste like it. I had a few pieces, then shared it with my family. Out of 6 other opinions, three said they did not like it, two really loved it, and one is just a candy addict so pretty much likes anything. So the vote is pretty much split, but all said it did taste a little like medicine. The flavor was not unpleasant, just a little strong. I love that it is made from organic sugar, and the texture is quite soft, but not gummy. Overall a good product, just not something I would seek out to buy again."

I mean who doesn't associate peanuts and Planters?<br /><br />Overall, Planters Creamy peanut butter is very creamy and I was very impressed at how easily it spreads onto bread. There was no clumping or oil separation and this tastes great on sandwiches or as a spoonful right out of the jar. It's not as sweet as other peanut butters, which many may prefer.<br /><br />I do have to agree with another reviewer who was disappointed that the oil used was hydrogenated soybean oil. This means the oil was treated with hydrogen gas to increase shelf life and change texture, which also elevates your ""bad"" cholesterol and lowers your ""good"" cholesterol.

81901,A. Burke,3,"Lickety Stik is an interesting idea. It's a small bottle filled with a thick brown liquid - a liquified dog treat, essentially - which you can squeeze out and smear over the top (sort of like gel deodorant). Your dog, I guess, is then supposed to lick this as a treat, but unfortunately my dog was just confused. I was still able to dab the liquid on his paw, and he seemed to like that quite a bit. So it still works for me to some extent.<br /><br />The big issue, I think, is that I'm not sure what the practical use of this product is. Maybe it's convenient for training; instead of carrying a bag of treats, you can just pop this thing in your pocket. Or I suppose if you have an elderly dog who has trouble with solids, it might come in handy. Otherwise it seems more convenient for me (and probably for many others) to stick with the dry treats."

The decaf variety is usually as flavorful and fragrant as regular caffeinated coffee, so I pretty much expected a coffee with low acid to be at least comparable with decaffeinated.  Not exactly, but it might have been my fault.  After checking the package carefully I could find nothing that indicated how much water to use with the packet contents.  So, I made a regular 8 cup brew.  Upon opening the package I did not get the burst of wonderful coffee fragrance.  No coffee fragrance while brewing either.  It tasted like coffee but, for me, it was just so-so... nothing to get excited about.  There again, I'll take the blame -- I probably had too much water.  That's why I picked 3 stars or ""middle of the road.""  If I have an opportunity to try it again with the right amount of coffee grounds for the water, I will surely update this review.  I hope they will indicate on their future packages how much water is recommended."

And although it's nice and crunchy, there is an extra little crunch at the end of the bite that is too much, like a little seed that is a little too hard and cracks more than crunches at the end. And the little seeds got stuck in my teeth."

It's also quite thin and not creamy--hence the YooHoo comparison.<br /><br />I would be willing to mix it with a protein powder to balance it out more, however it lists unsourced maltodextrin that I'm not comfortable with.  The product does not specifically say that the maltodextrin is not gluten-free, which leaves me having to believe that it is derived from gluten.  That said, I only consumed a few sips.<br /><br />Not for me, and from what I know of building muscle, way too high in poor carbs to aid much with that.  Round it out with a good protein powder and you may be on to something."
355078,K.W.,3,"I bought this for my mom's three cats... and only one of the three actually plays with it.  One cat looked at it, sniffed it, batted it once or twice and walked away.  The second time he ""played"" with it, he managed to get a piece of kibble out... and walked away.  He isn't one to walk away from food so that was interesting.<br /><br />Kitty #2 walks past it.<br /><br />Kitty #3 will actually play, get some food out, eat it.  Maybe bat it two or three more times then walk away.<br /><br />It seems to be constructed well, easy to put some kibble or other small bites in, and isn't obnoxious when the cat actually play with it. That's why it gets a decent rating.  I don't want to knock it because these cats have their preferences :)<br /><br />However, I would not purchase a toy like this again knowing how the cats reacted. My mom keeps it out, but it is definitely not their ""go to"" toy, even with their favorite treats inside."
475518,"Sheri ""musical lover""",3,"I have enjoyed this flavor for several years.  I usually buy in large quantities because it really is a difficult flavor to find.  I just received my order from this listing.  The containers are different.  The packaging is white, and rather than the little plastic ""tubs"" with the foil sealed top, the powder now comes in a sealed pouch.  It is essentially a larger version of the little single serving pouches that are sold everywhere which you can add to a bottled water.  Well, the new packaging doesn't bother me (who cares), but the taste is very different, and NOT in a good way!  There is a strong artificial sweetener taste, and a very strong AFTERTASTE!  I am very disappointed because I really liked the original Ruby Red Grapefruit flavor.  A few years ago they changed the original flavor to the ""Sunrise"" Ruby Red Grapefruit, which was OK, but I never really liked how the drink was not clear anymore, but now ""opaque"" or ""chalky"" looking.  The taste was still good though.  This newest change however, is not acceptable.  The flavor is barely recognizable.  I honestly used to CRAVE this stuff.  I would drink a quart or two almost every day.  I have no interest in this new stuff.  Has anyone else noticed the change in taste?"
74090,"E. A. Jones ""movie buff""",3,"Having tried all of the Taco Bell bottled sauces, I have to say this is my least favorite. The chipotle flavor is very powdery, almost chalky, and the overall taste is extremely strong. You don't have to use much of it, literally 1-2 drops on a taco is all you would need, but I found it unpleasant. The other flavors are smooth and well balanced, but the chipotle flavor just doesn't cut it. The consistency of the sauce is good and it lasts a good long time in the fridge, and the 8-oz bottle goes a lot farther than you think it will."
268233,Natasha Stryker,3,"Nature's Path wants to lead you to a better breakfast, but better than what?  If you eat fruit loops, than this is probably healthier.  If you eat oatmeal in the morning, then this is not a better bowl.<br /><br />Let's start with VALUE:<br />This is a primarily a puffed cereal with some flakes.  The side of the box says a serving is 2/3 cup, but since it is mostly just puffs I think 1 cup is a better serving size to provide closer to what one needs to make it a couple of hours without your stomach growling.  Dense cereals like granola or Grape-nuts are an ample breakfast in a 2/3 cup serving but this is not.  So following that logic you don't get 10 servings in a box, you get about 6-7 -- so figure 1 box will last a week.  So about 55 cents a meal, not too bad.<br /><br />NUTRITION:<br />There are 7 grams of sugar in a 2/3 cup serving, so almost 10 grams for a cup of cereal.  I was shocked that this cereal didn't have more vitamins, the only thing it had was 4% iron.  It doesn't have gluten, but this is a moot point if you don't suffer from a legitimate allergy or condition were gluten makes you sick.  Gluten-free is so trendy right now I feel like this product is hitting a lot of buzz words but not hitting the mark on nutrition.<br /><br />TASTE:<br />The second ingredient is sweetener, and you can really tell.  I was shocked it tasted so sweet for being touted as a healthy cereal.  To me it tastes like a vanilla flavored  kid's cereal.  It is a mix of large corn puffs, seed-sized puffs that I assume are flax and flakes.  The texture is nice and crunchy but it doesn't hew up the roof of your mouth.  It is not good to eat dry because of the teeny-tiny sedd puffs, they get everywhere.  This might be good used to spruce up other cereals, like add 1/3 cup of it to half a bowl of bran flakes or something.  Or you can feed it to your kid as a breakfast treat.  My toddler LOVED a bowl of this cereal, but I wouldn't give it to her every morning.<br /><br />OTHER:<br />This stuff worked great in some homemade granola bars I made.  I cut out 2/3 of the sweetener and added this cereal in hopes of making them less dense and it worked great.  Gave them a bit of a ""Rice Crispy Treat"" texture.<br /><br />OVERALL: This cereal gets 3 stars because it does have decent fiber (4) and protein (almost 3) for a cup of cold cereal that doesn't taste like twigs.  I would want it again to add to my granola bars.  It would be good for kids who want a ""sugar cereal"" fix, but remember to give them some fruit with it since this isn't sprayed with vitamins.  Not great, but not horrible.  I guess if this was marketed as a kids cereal with a silly cartoon bear on the box we'd all be amazed at how good for you it is compared to Captain Crunch."

I can't explain it, but would be interested to know if anyone else has experienced this, so I can see if it's just me, or the product.<br /><br />I paid $10 more than the on line price, so it was costly, and not sure if I will buy again."

56863,Rachael Mei,3,"I bought the Bigelow Green Tea after tasting how delicious the Bigelow I Love Lemon tea is. Here's a few pros and cons.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Price wise - great price, $14.99 after 15% with Subscribe & Save and Free shipping for 240 tea bags comes out to around 6.2 cents each tea bag<br /><br />Cons:<br />Figured they be individually wrapped like the I Love Lemon tea but it's not. These 40 count boxes are not packaged individually in foil packs but there are 4 tea bags in 1 foil pack and not resealable.  Therefore, if you're not a frequent tea drinker, the tea bags might loose freshness after you open the foil pack after a few days.  If you want individually packaged tea bags, you should look at the Bigelow Green Tea, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6).<br /><br />If I leave the tea bag in my cup for more than a minute, I will see loose tea particles on the bottom of my cup, leaving the last mouthful of tea undrinkable. This problem does not happen in the I Love Lemon tea by Bigelow even if I leave the tea bag in my cup for more than 10 mins.  I'm not sure if there's a same problem in the Bigelow Green Tea, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6) because I haven't tried that yet.<br /><br />Taste wise - okay, same as any ordinary green tea.<br /><br />Drink for health benefits!"
240350,"OpheliasOwn ""jh17ophelia""",3,"So, the nutritional properties of Beneful are there for you to decide of your own volition, but as for a dog food my dogs like, this is it. I mixed it with Taste of the Wild which is grain free (and the mixture might be seen as sacrilege for the purists), but the dogs enjoyed it solo and in the mixture. I do notice they eat it by color though. The red kibble bits go first. Actually one dog loves the red kibble bits so much she dumps the whole bowl to get the red ones. Then goes the green, and finally the brown bits. Not sure what that is about, but it seems to be pretty standard by now. She actually started to growl when the other dogs came to eat before she was done with the red bits.<br /><br />The bag is easy to open and can be zipped closed, which I appreciate. The kibble size is relatively small, so for my mini doxies, it is pretty perfect. My sister's yellow lab came by, though, and I am fairly certain he didn't even have to chew- just inhaled and the bowl was empty. So I think this food is fine, but nutritionally questionable..."

73128,Theo,3,"For those of you not familiar with the cherry ripe, the filling is a dried and slightly candied mince of cherries and coconut. This is coated with a thin outer layer of dark chocolate. They are extremely popular in Australia, where I live, and are in fact one of the classic candy bars we all grew up with.<br /><br />On the plus side, these things are delicious. So if they don't sell them where you are and you have a yen to try another culture's junk food, let me say cherry ripes are a pretty good choice.<br /><br />On the other hand, at the current price this pack of six works out at over $3.32 per bar. That is a little rich for a chocolate bar, which is the main reason I gave this product only three stars. If I'd felt it to be more reasonably priced I would've gone up to four.<br /><br />Unusually, on a per gram basis I'm pretty sure <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002X1831C"">Cadbury Cherrry Ripe Multipack</a> offers better value.

60192,Amber,3,"I'm not usually a big peppermint fan, but am a lover of the peppermint mochas that starbucks has seasonally. However, since the calories in those are so high, I got these to cut down on how many trips I made to the coffee shop - and on the cost.  Pretty darn good, and definitely much lower in calories, sugar, and fat in comparison to the originals. Still not as good as the original, but it helps cut the craving down :)  Good cost cutter, option, too, as long as you buy them either direct from the Tassimo company online, or from a place like BB&B (bed, bath...). The price here, if for only 1 package is ridiculous. Twentyfive? Ten is more of the standard pricing.  I believe BBB offers free ship online for single serve coffees like this, too.  Tassimo often does sales and always does free ship over 50 buckaroos.  If you sign up for emails from Tassimo, they often send out deals and sales on their stuff, too.<br /><br />There were a couple of cons, though. One is that they only offer the Peppermint Mocha seasonally, so that may be part of the high cost here on amazon right now.  The second downside is that there was a bit of a chemically aftertaste.  Nothing horrible, but definitely noticeable."

116169,Another Choosy Shopper,3,"I must admit, I wasn't a huge fan. I mean, when something has the word ""sour"" in the title, it's supposed to be, well, sour. These candies are simply jelly gummies that are basically rolled in sugar. Yes, there is a very little hint of citric acid (the ingredient that is supposed to make the sugar sour tasting), but there was not enough of it added to that batch. These flavor of the jelly gummies, on the other hand, are quite fresh tasting, resembling the flavors from a variety of different fruits and berries.<br /><br />For comparison purposes, if Sour Patch Kids would be considered a ""6"" on a 10-point sour scale, these Sour Poppers would only be considered a ""3"" on the same 10-point sour scale. However, regardless of the UN-sourness of the candy, the value (price) is truly unbeatable. You will not find a lightly sour candy any cheaper (per pound) anywhere else!"

84611,Mark Arrington,3,"Before being GF, my main pastas were DiCecco, a common imported brand which cooks up authentically al dente, and Barilla, which in American comes from the mid-west (not as good as the real-Italian Barilla that we don't import).  Tinkyada pasta has a pretty strong brown rice tase and a slightly off aftertaste.  The texture is a little slippery, and it disintegrates a bit while cooking.  It's still pretty good if you serve it with a sauce that you would put on a plate of brown rice, i.e., a sauce with its own texture and assertive flavor.  It's not as good if the pasta is the star of the dish.  Of the brands I've tried, Jovial is by far the best.  The brown rice taste is minimal, even nice, and it cooks more al dente than the regular wheat American brands."

However, at 15 pods to a pack, this a week's worth of coffee if you drink a 15 oz mug every morning, as I do. So, while it is a good coffee when made properly, the value just is not there for me with this product.<br /><br />If you're okay with that, because you see value added by the social marketing related to this product, then go for it.<br /><br />If you're just after good coffee, you can probably get just as good a cup with a different brand for a little less."

However, after spending a small fortune on coloring, I'm loathe to use this product: it contains sodium laureth sulfate, which can fade color more rapidly than shampoos without it.<br /><br />The fragrance is almost like a citrus, but a bit too cloying for my preference. The scent doesn't really linger after washing, though, which is good.<br /><br />The major drawback is actually a functional design. The bottle's closure and cap doesn't avoid inadvertent opening and leaking. The product arrived, having opened during shipment, and had spilled all over the inside of the shipping box. This meant a loss of about 1/4-1/3 of the shampoo; had there been other items in the box, they would've been destroyed. A similar issue was encountered when packing it in luggage for a trip."

BUT THEY LIST IT AS 0 GRAMS. BUT NOBODY USES JUST ONE TABLESPOON!! I use FOUR to FIVE tablespoons per serving, as does my wife.

(It's great for getting the correct ratio of healthy fats into your diet for bulking phases though!)  I've tried other PB substitues like Better 'N Peanut Butter and PB2(PB2 is a powdered peanut butter mix with about 1/4 the calories and fat of regular PB, and it tastes just like the normal stuff) and they are not bad.  But I still can't eat as much of it as I want.<br /><br />As soon as I saw this, my first thought was ""SWEET!!! THIS MIGHT ACTUALLY BE GOOD!""  I read some reviews, thought for 25 seconds, ordered 3 jars, and didn't really have too high of expectations since it is a calorie free product.<br /><br />Well, it kind of tastes like roasted peanuts... kind of.  I'd say it's more of a fake sugar/bitter coffee/peanut flavored pudding product.  If you can imagine the aftertaste you get from the fake sugar in diet coke, you can kind of imagine this.<br /><br />It's not a total failure though, because I am still going to use this, but not by itself.  I tried mixing a few tablespoons of this with a tablespoon of regular creamy PB and a little bit of PB2 powder.  The normal PB enhances the peanut taste where this stuff left off, and the PB2 gives it the right texture.  After all that, it's really not bad.  I'd even say pretty good.  Regular PB has about 100 calories per tablespoon and a ton of fat.  This mixed PB concoction has maybe 25 calories per tablespoon.  Not bad.<br /><br />The walden farms grape jelly is great, and does taste like real jelly.

Having said that, the brewed coffee sold inside an actual Starbucks is often about the same as these, so if you can enjoy that, you may like these, and enjoy the convenience and savings.<br /><br />As with all the T-discs, you can improve your experience by starting with a warm cup/mug/glass and by never using the add more-water-to-overextract-the-grounds feature.

I immediately used 18 of the 50+ to make homemade vanilla extract. The beans did not come with storage instructions so I googled it and read that I needed to store them in an airtight container. I've used them a few times over the past month for cooking but I still had over half the package left. Well, when I opened them this evening they were MOLDED. I am so very disappointed that I will be unable to use the rest of my beans. :( If you're able to use all 50 as soon as you get them, then I highly recommend these beans. If not, then I would look elsewhere, or order a smaller quantity."

They do just melt in the mouth, perfect because he only had 5 teeth at the time. The only negative I have for these is some of the puffs are fairly large! If I give my son a handful of them, he stuffs them in his mouth, so the larger ones make me nervous. I ususally cut them in half. My new find would be the Target Up & Up brand - they are fairly cheaper & they are all the same size (perfectly smaller) So from now on, I will be saving a few bucks, and using those!"

100194,Brett,3,"I get a kick out of the reviews I read on Amazon and I think the bulk of them are honest and posted by regular Joes and JoAnnes.  I grew up in Texas and have lived here most of my life thus far and I also remember growing up being a big fan of ""RSB"", aka Ranch Style Beans.  I can't really remember a time when we did not have at least one can of the tasty little red colored beans in the pantry, and they went great with most any meal you could put together on a budget, which my mother always seemed to be able to do.  They used to come in a now politically incorrect can which featured the words ""Husband Pleasin'"" where it says ""Appetite Pleasin'"" now.  Same face however.  I don't recall who manufactured them then, but a group called Conagra does now and I am sorry I have to agree with the folks who say that the quality and taste have declined a bit from what I recall.  Used to be you got a can full of beans and the sauce was mildly thick and wonderfully flavorful.  Nowdays it seems a bit watery to me and not nearly as flavorful as before and I have even bought a can or two that have been mostly watery sauce as opposed to full of beans.  RSB has taken a hit and nobody seems to care.  I hope Conagra makes the right decision and gives us back the RSB we used to know and love.  Ugh."

72665,Colene M. White,3,"Not sure what the problem was, but neither of my dogs accepted these treats if an option was available.  If this was the only thing offered, they seemed to take them with a disinterested attitude.  They were made in such a way that the dogs didn't devour them in a few seconds, so were long-lasting, and were a good size to take up some time when you want something to occupy your dog for a longer amount of time.  I may try another flavor of these, as I did like the long-lasting aspect of these treats."
313882,"Marshall Carter ""Ornery Gamer, Fiend Club Member""",3,"Taco Bell Bold & Creamy Spicy Ranchero Sauce isn't bad, but it's not anything that's going to change how you approach tacos either. It's basically a thick Ranch Dressing with some Mexican spices (chili powder seeming to be the most obvious) thrown in to spice things up a bit. Don't get this thinking that it's going to be spicy as in ""hot,"" because it definitely isn't. It's basically just a creamy Ranch dressing given the Taco Bell treatment. I wasn't impressed with the smell at all, but after trying it on a burrito and a couple of tacos, it's pretty good. The suggested serving size (2 tablespoons) seems a bit much if you're only eating a few tacos, and you could probably get away with a bit less on a taco salad (it's thicker than a regular salad dressing). All-in-all, it's not a bad product and it tastes reasonably good, but it's just not good enough to be a must-buy."
436864,The Pink Apron,3,I bought this as a gift for a friend. The espresso pods smell wonderful but I was disappointed with the way they were packaged. All the pods came in a ziploc bag. It is fine and I don't like giving only 3 stars but I can't give it 4 stars. It would have been really nice if they were packaged in a box for gift giving. But if you are looking to try different types of espresso this is definitely the way to go.

247348,B. Redd,3,"When I first got the product, I was a bit disappointed to realize that it's quite low calorie (50 calories/packet, 4 packets/box, 2 packets = 1 1/2 cups of soup). To me, that means that it doesn't really suffice as a meal, which I was hoping it would sometimes. However, on the upside, it does taste really good. Sometimes it's just what you need. So I consider it a decent product, even though it's so low-calorie it can't be anything close to a real meal."

I've a subscription to 30 packets of Nong Shim's Gourmet Spicy noodles & was expecting this to be much better. Really, the taste is great. Same type of noodles, texture, etc..same spicy flavor packet but there is another packet of soup seasoning included. There's no dried vegetables packet like the Gourmet Spicy flavor has. No dried vegetables flakes & no beef chunks like the description stated, thus false marketing. The price is too much for this. If this is the new & improved Gourmet Spicy noodles, I'd give it 4 stars. I took off 2 stars because of the unworthy price tag & another star because of the false marketing. I read a comment reply in another review here - A Korean reviewer... I agree entirely. Big hype & price tag but disappoints. I'll stick to the Gourmet Spicy if I were you. Worth the try but not 18 packets!<br /><br />Edit: Not false marketing since it seems like only the very first packet had no dried beef & vegetable so I changed the rating to a 3 star. However, the beef ""chunks"" are just flakes. Not enough flakes to notice. There are also dried mushrooms. Now, the mushroom pieces are bigger than the ones in the Spicy Gourmet vegetable sachet. Still, not impressed. 1/29/2012"

198830,"C. Sarges ""winterfyre""",3,"This peanut butter is very tasty ~ BUT.  As with the majority of natural peanut butters, this one has to be stirred when it is first opened to redistribute the oils.  This particular peanut butter doesn't seem to have enough oil, which means when you're about halfway through the jar, the peanut butter is like concrete - very unspreadable.  I am on my third jar of the 4-pack, and it is like this every time, even after many minutes of stirring.  It still tastes good, so if you're eating it right out of the jar, that might not be a problem.  I spread it on toast, and spreading concrete is very challenging!  So, this peanut butter would get 5 stars for flavor and ingredients, but I took two stars off for spreadability."

401105,Arenne,3,"I have celiac disease and have tried most of the GF mixes around. Bob's Red Mill's GF Cornbread is cheap and easy to find in most grocers. However, I find much to be desired when it comes to the flavor and texture of this product. Someone mentioned it earlier - there is NOT enough liquid. Cornbread should be moist, and if you ever try the mix by Gluten Free Pantry it is very much so. Also, this cornbread has a gritty and sour flavor. Not my choice. Finally, when you bake them into muffins, they tend to get rock hard on the outside while still gooey on the inside.<br /><br />The Gluten Free Pantry Cornbread Mix is hard to find, so I have adapted this mix to taste similar. Instead of 1.5 cups of milk, put in 2 cups of buttermilk (or nearly 2 cups of regular milk with a tablespoon of vinegar). Add one more tablespoon of butter and a little sugar or splenda.<br /><br />People with celiac disease should NOT have to suffer poor quality products. We tend to forget what those taste like. Don't settle!!"

10677,"M. McAdams ""Mikayla""",3,"I originally tried this as a part of a variety pack. I'm glad I didn't buy the whole package. If you like richer hot chocolates, then you will not like this. I tried making this hot chocolate on all three settings (smaller, medium, larger cups on the three option Keurig machines). All of the options tasted too watery for me. I would often add creamer to try to substitute for the lack of flavor to them.  If this is a machine you have in your office and are looking for something different than coffee, it is, like the stars-rating claims, okay. It tastes like what it is - a mediocre hot chocolate they added to a coffee line to simply offer variety.<br /><br />Personally, I prefer to just use Swiss Miss packets and use the Keurig to heat the water. You get better taste (by a company known for hot chocolate) and the convenience of the Keurig machine. Plus, you save a lot of money."

Maybe Zevia needs to find something that tastes more like Black Cherry.  I won't buy any more at a buck a can but if you've got a good imagination..."
538345,"Shanshad ""shanachie_shadowfax""",3,"I think it was Jean Luc Picard with his ""Earl Grey, hot."" on Star Trek:TNG that first had me try that particular type of tea.  But it rapidly has become my favorite in the family of black teas with flavoring. I've enjoyed trying out many different brands of Earl Grey to narrow in on my favorites, so when the opportunity came along to try Higgins & Burke's Earl Grey, I snagged the chance.<br /><br />Among other brands I tend to dislike Bigelow as being too mild and flavorless.  Twinings and Stash both make a fair cup of Earl Grey, and they tend to be my regular brands to buy from the store shelves when I'm in need of more.  Both have a robust black tea with a nice balance of bergamot oil and fragrance that appeals to me.  I tend to prefer a stronger tea that holds up well with milk.  When I'm splurging on my favorite, it's usually Good Earth Earl Grey.  Higgins @ Burke's Earl Grey, I'm afraid to say, falls somewhere between Bigelow and Stash teas for me.<br /><br />My chief complaint is that it is too mild--it's a very delicate version of the tea that really doesn't hold up well with milk.  There's also a very odd sort of dry anise flavor to the tea that doesn't match up with my expectations for Earl Grey.  The bergamot flavor is there, but it isn't super strong.  This is best for tea drinkers who prefer lighter blends, more delicate teas and probably drink their Earl Grey plain.  It just doesn't match up with my preferences.<br /><br />Given that I've also tried Higgins @ Burke's Green tea, my observation would be that this company overall delivers a milder version of teas with some unexpected flavors.  Not bad, certainly, but not really *my* cup of tea.<br /><br />Happy Drinking! ^_^ Shanshad"
27882,"Philly gal ""phillygal""",3,"I was overall disappointed with this basket.  While the salami and cheese spread were good, much of the rest of the basket seemed to be fillers.  The box of chocolates actually contained wrapped candy (a mallo cup, a peanut butter cup and some of what was once called penny candy).  There were crackers and pretzels (a small bag contained two hard pretzels).  I realize with a purchase like this you are really paying a premium for the packaging and delivery but I thought this one was a little light on actual food."
196506,davepy,3,"I love vinegar, and vinegar flavored foods.  I was looking forward to enjoying fries (chips) and other foods with the great vinegar flavor w/o getting them mushy using actual malt vinegar, but I can't add too much of the powdered malt salt w/o the dishes getting too much salt.  Basically, if you're making the foods at home, or can order them with no salt added, it's about perfect, but if you were to add them to, say, McDonalds fries, they become too salty.<br /><br />There are other reviews pointing out the salt component isn't very large, but any amount is too much for me.  I wished they'd offered just the powdered vinegar, which I can only seem to find in bulk.  Having said that, it's still a good product, esp if you can get around the salt issue, like by cooking your own food."
215201,Willow,3,"We decided to purchase Weber N'Orleans Cajun Seasoning because we figured if it boasted the New Orleans name, it had to be good stuff.  But, we were slightly let down by the overall spiciness of this seasoning.<br /><br />The first time I used it, I just used a little on the fish I made.  This was because in the past, some Cajun flavored foods were very spicy, and when I smelled the spice after opening it, it smelled strong.  But as we ate the fish, we could barley taste the Cajun!<br /><br />This spice is good for those who don't want an overpowering or highly spicy Cajun flavoring.  Sometimes I myself like that, but if I'm using Cajun, I usually want it to be bold.<br /><br />Add a little extra paprika alongside this seasoning and it greatly enhances it.<br /><br />Overall it isn't terrible, but it isn't as bold as one might expect from a N'Orleans Cajun."

249436,James D. Nichol,3,"These little cans, especially when very cold, are very refreshing.  It tastes good. I liked the drink but I'm not wild about the strawberry part of the mix.  It kind of tasted a little stale to me, not in an obvious or overt way but in the after-taste (a little). The carbonation is just right, it adds tanginess without coming back up my nose or giving me gas.  Which I think, is a big plus because it is a common problem many other carbonated drinks have.<br /><br />So they got the flavor and the carbonation right.  However....<br /><br />Personally, I like more than eight 1/2 ounces in a beverage.  I'm a 210 pound guy and when I'm thirsty 8 1/2 isn't going to do it.  But then I looked at the calories --- 134!<br /><br />Holy smokes!  There is only 100 calories in a regular Coke. So I looked at the ingredients expecting the manufacture added a ton of sugar.<br /><br />Nope! All natural ingredients including the lightly carbonated water in Switch drinks. This is also a big plus but at some point I would think they would scale back the fruit juice to water ratio to keep the natural sugar level lower.<br /><br />I think they make a tasty, natural product but it's not for me because its too small and has too many calories."

Granted its a little sugar I guess compared to lots of convience products plus I am not Bavarian cuisine by birth.  But watch out on all labels for sugar if you don't added it yourself cause if they do they ruined your dish by your tastes.  I have had other dishes unpalateable to me because a canned ingredient had sugar i didn't expect and this product does.  Only a little sugar can kill a good dish when others expect it'  That's not what i expect to happened to me.

223713,jt,3,"When this arrived in the mail I opened it up and let my kids have some for a snack and it was ridiculous.  They went crazy when they tasted the chocolate and I had to confiscate the stuff before they ate the entire box.  When I asked if they wanted milk in their bowls of cereal they scoffed at the idea of diluting the chocolaty goodness.  They pretty much consider this stuff a treat like getting a cookie or piece of candy.  This is somewhat appropriate since a serving (3/4 cup which is a lot less than what my 3 year old can eat) contains 24g carbs of which 11g are from sugar.  Looking in my pantry I found an 8oz bag of Chips Ahoy Mini Chocolate Chip cookies that contains 21g carbs with 9g of sugar.  To be fair, the Krave nutrition label is in line with many of the cereals marketed to young kids these days.  Similar to Cocoa Puffs, Capt. Crunch, etc.  However, in looking at Kellogs' marketing of this stuff I don't think they are going after young children.  I believe they are targeting tweens, teens, and young adults.  I'm not sure that makes anything better or worse.  Just an observation...  Anyway, the cereal does taste sweet and chocolaty and crunchy like they advertise.  Far too sweet for me to imagine sitting down and eating in a bowl with milk.  I admit I have reached in and taken a small handful to munch on when craving something sweet.  However, I would not be a buyer of Krave cereal for my young kids as I think that similar to most of the cereals marketed to kids they are just too high in sugars and empty calories.  The vitamin fortification all the companies do is really just a way of distracting consumers and really offer little in terms of healthy nutrition.  I will step off of the Michael Pollan soap box and say that the stuff does taste good as advertised and if you get it, eat it as sort of a treat and not a main course.  Remember, back fat is never coming in to style..."

Albeit, taste might have been better if I added some fresh bean sprouts, basil leaves, and shrimp or chicken.<br /><br />Price: Not bad considering it's a third of what  you would pay for compared to take out.<br /><br />All in all, I give it 3 stars. This is like the cup o noodle of Pad Thai. Decent enough to consume if you really run out of food, but not something you'll be craving during lunch hour."
525841,Judy J. Sikes,3,"I was so happy to get this order, but unfortunately when I used the first bottle, it tastes old, on the verge of being bad.  The sediment was way thicker than a fresh bottle should have had.  I am not at all sure I will even use the other 5 bottles."
274424,Melanie L. Goddard,3,If you want to buy this to set on a shelf.  Go for it!  It's kinda cute and fun to have around while gaming.  However if you actually intend to drink it. DONT!!!  It tastes nastier than anything I've ever drank.  It gave me a headache.  I've tried alot of energy drinks and none have been this nasty or made me feel totaly sick like that.
524064,Labarum,3,"There are three ways you can judge Nabisco's SnackWell's Caramel Drizzle Popcorn:  taste, health/diet concerns, and price.  On the first count, these are excellent.  Given it mixes caramel and popcorn, there will inevitably be some similarly to Cracker Jack, but these have a far better flavor in my book.  On the diet/health side, the only major concern is the high sugar content but then the pluses elsewhere are likely achieved by the small package side more than anything.  Where it lets down is in the pricing.  $35 for a half dozen small bags of popcorn??  I might expect that in a movie theatre but not in the marketplace.  So give it 5 stars on taste, 3 on health/diet, and 1 on pricing."
44662,"Jacob Hantla ""hantla.com""",3,"I was particularly excited to try Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds when they arrived in the mail today as I love chocolate and I love nuts.<br /><br />Five individuals ranging in age from 2 to 50 tried these together and shared feedback. A few common threads emerged.<br /><br />1. Chocolate doesn't come off on your hands: Very convenient as there is almost no residue left on hands even after holding a handful of nuts for a minute.<br /><br />2. Very subtle chocolate flavor: For some this is a plus and for some this is a negative. You know the chocolate is there, but in my opinion it just leave you wanting more chocolate. I couldn't eat more than 10 or so for that reason. They were just plain frustrating. This was the consensus of 4 out of the 5 taste testers. The fifth loved them and plans on finishing off my canister and probably ordering more. They are definitely not milk chocolately, but have barely discernible, subtle dark chocolate undertones.<br /><br />3. Dry: We all needed to drink water immediately after tasting the nuts as they dried our mouths out, much more than normal salted or roasted almost or any other nut for that matter. Three of us described them as tasting ""burnt"" or ""too roasted"".<br /><br />4. We keep eating them: Even though I'm not crazy about these nuts -  in fact only one of us was - we keep coming back for more about every hour or so. I get frustrated every time I do, either wanting a chocolate bar or just some plain old chocolate. Perhaps this is a good trait in a snack, that you can't keep eating them ad nauseum.<br /><br />Other observations<br />The 11 oz ergonomically comfortable container is about 8 inches tall and fits perfectly in your hand or in the cup holder of the car. The lid is screw-on rather than flip-top. The package contains 11 servings of 150 calories apiece (120 calories from fat), 13 grams of fat, six grams of carbs, and 6 grams of protein. Very much the same as other nut products.<br /><br />The conclusion? If you aren't sure already that you love these nuts, buying a four-pack might be too much for you. But if you love them, you love them, as evidenced by our one taste tester and many of the other reviews. I'd recommend trying a smaller volume before ordering in bulk here."
92979,A. Woodmansee,3,"I LOVE Velveta but stopped eating 9 years ago when we switched to a healthy diet.  My kids, especially one of them in particular, loves mac n cheese, and that same mac n cheese addict also loves broccoli, so I thought this was a no brainer.  My husband and I liked the flavor, but the kids hated it.  I was expecting basically Velveta shells and cheese with broccoli and chicken and instead was flavored with chicken broth and less a mac n cheese than something else I guess.  This is most likely why the kids did not like it.  The ""pasta"" was small little rice sized/shaped pasta, forget what it is called, but I prefer larger pasta than that.  The broccoli was non-existent, it was a tiny packet of freeze dried broccoli ""florets"" that only added little green flecks to the meal, poorly done Kraft.  This product is high in sodium and calories and has many ingredients with hidden MSG in them (anything hydrolyzed or autolyzed and anythign that says ""protein extract"" or yeast extract) and it does not give anyone any vegetables.  Honestly a person is better off cooking from chicken and broccoli and adding it to Velveta shells and cheese."

89582,Loves those books,3,Our dog LOVES this food. He woofs it down as soon as I put it in his bowl. The look of the food is very appetizing and I'm sure the taste is as well. However it gives him horrible gas! The first night he ate it he had gas for several hours. The second night I mixed it with his regular dog food and the gas wasn't nearly as bad. But I won't be buying this again. It is more expensive than what we usually give him and with the gas it just isn't worth it.
507035,Lien K Quach,3,"The Lindt Naps are delicious chocolate. I purchased 10 Naps boxes for Christmas gifts; however, not all boxes could be given out as gifts because some of the boxes were damaged upon arrival due to bad packaging quality control. Just want to clarify that the damage was not due to shipping since the outer shipping box was in good condition. It was the inner box and the actual Naps box was damaged in of the corner."

Unfortunately my skin has not liked it at all.  I've been using it on my face, and it has actually made my skin drier and flakier.  I don't understand why this would happen."
264394,Andrew J. Badertscher,3,"These taste fine, but they are sliced oddly (not into wedge like slices like I expected them to be).  Since the slices are so thin, they crush easily and every package I've opened has been at least 1/2 crushed up little bits of fruit.  This is great if you're adding them to something, such as oatmeal, but not so good for eating out of hand. I will not order these again, as I had purchased them for my baby and they are too small for his little fingers.  Overall, I'm disappointed in this product and will not reorder."
75671,"E. Kay ""eclectic6""",3,"I am not too familiar with energy drinks, so my experience is somewhat limited. I was feeling pretty draggy at around 6pm, and it was a Friday night, so I felt like I needed a boost. The can said it had 2 servings, but I went ahead and downed the whole thing. Within a minute or so, my head was tingling and my eyes were like saucers. Is this normal?? I don't know if it was a placebo effect or if this stuff actually had an effect on me. It might have also had something to do with the video game I was playing, but I can't say for sure. Caffeine usually doesn't have a big effect on me... aside from causing an occasional acne flare up. (The side of the can DOES say it's not recommended for people who are sensitive to caffeine, so I'm assuming there's some caffeine in there).<br /><br />As for the taste, it wasn't wonderful, but it wasn't terrible either. It tasted like Sprite mixed with Pomegranate juice. It wasn't the best beverage I've ever had, but it certainly wasn't the worst.<br /><br />I'm happy to report I didn't have any sort of crash afterward. I don't know if it really had an effect on me, or if it was all in my head. Nevertheless, this drink certainly wouldn't be bad to try."
62096,"D. Dell ""Dell""",3,"I have tried spiced chai tea, but it did not have enough spices. I also tried a mix where you just add water, but they were too sweet. I prefer a stronger spice flavor and I like to be able to control the amount of milk and sugar. So, I usually make my own chai spiced tea from scratch. I get just the right amount of ingredients, but it is a lot of trouble and takes time.<br /><br />Then I tried the Stash Double Spiced Chai Tea. With more spice than most other teas I found the flavor and intensity to be fairly close to my home-made chai. This chai tea is able to maintain the flavor of the black tea with a nice blend of spices that give it a little extra kick with the double-spice. Of course, with more spices comes more bitterness. The way to lessen the bitterness is to slightly increase the milk and sugar. A better way to help cut the bitterness is to use honey instead of sugar.<br /><br />I will still make my own home-made version when I have the time to make it. But, I will also use this Stash Double Spice Chai Tea as an alternative until I find something better."

Fresh coffees.  I personally like coffees from Spain, Puerto Rico and other countries.<br /><br />The bad, sometimes is messy.  Coffee grinds seem to leak, creating a slight mess and the need to clean the machine.  This leak is more in the area of the Kups lid and cup.  And some times these grinds even get in your cup of coffee.  Just read other reviews about this.  Not sure if it could be related to how fine are the grinds of coffee.<br /><br />On the other hand, with disposable Kups you don't need to keep cleaning wire filter baskets.  That's a very plus.<br /><br />All considered will probably buy again, but wish a better lid/cup seal that will not leak.  Hope down the road they will offer improved DisposableKups."
295250,"Scott ""Scottso""",3,"Maybe it's due to my tendency to prefer noodles with a little more ""kick"", but I found this product to be very bland and not very flavorful.  Of all the noodles produced by Nong Shim, this is my least favorite. The flavor is extremely subtle (it almost has a chocolate taste!) and its almost like eating noodles plain.  If you like even mildly spicy noodles you will probably not like this at all and I would suggest going with any other flavor -- they are all good.<br /><br />This honestly is the very first Nong Shim noodle that I was disappointed with and I've tried a lot of them.  Of course with food its all subjective.  If you don't mind a very subtle flavor you might like this.  I would recommend finding a single packet to try before you buy a package of 20, unless your tastes lean toward the less flavorful side."
504267,"N. Beitler ""Avid Reader""",3,"I received a sample of this candy through the vine program. I chose it because it had the word ""Energy"" in the title, and there are some times when I feel like I could use a boost. Those times are not frequent, mind you, but it's nice to have something on hand when you want it. The first night I tried this candy was on Halloween, as I escorted my children through the surrounding neighborhoods with some other parents. I popped on of these in my mouth, as did another parent I had offered it to. We both thought the taste was good (if you like honey, you'll like these, for sure, as that's all you can taste), but neither of us felt any sort of energy boost as we spent a few hours walking around. My wife tried one the next day (thought it was a bit too sweet) and said she felt a slight energy boost. I had another one the next day and offered one to a co-worker, who accepted. As before, neither of us felt any noticeable bump in out energy levels. Maybe the energy boost is psychosomatic? You WANT to feel it, so some people decide they DO feel it? I don't know. For me, it just boiled down to this being a good-tasting candy that had slightly more dietary value than most candies. Would I buy it in the store? Probably not."

The smell is a bit more pungent and accidic but, the taste is still smooth and rich without burning your stomach. For the price it is a good option to tide yourself over until you can make it back to the island. IF you want the REAL DEAL by the kind on the brown sack but 9 times out of 10 by the time it arrives to you and you pay for shipping the beans will be so DRY you should have spent the same amount of money on a trip to Jamaica.

95614,Nick Alec,3,"These are decent Granola bars to give a try-out. There is not much chocolate flavor, to me it seemed more fiber and peanut butter oriented and that's leaves your mouth a dry after-taste.<br />One thing that annoyed me is that some peanut butter drops fall off. Just a pet peeve of mine but wanted to point it out for others like me. Dont see why they couldn't just make it a drizzle like the chocolate or inside the bar.<br /><br />Anyways, overall its got a decent taste and if your in the market for specifically a chocolate and peanut butter Granola bar, you can give this a try-out. Also one thing to consider is these are relatively high in fat for (10% daily sat. fat) and calories (110)."
566385,"E. J Tastad ""ejt""",3,"Pros:<br />Three times as much fiber as original Mac'n'cheese (3g v 1g / serving)<br /><br />Cons:<br />Costs more than twice as much per serving as original.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />Just buy the normal mac and cheese and get your fiber elsewhere.  Nutrition content per serving is nearly identical (as boxed), and as prepared they tell you to use half as much margarine in the vegi mac and cheese vs the normal, so don't compare the ""as prepared"" nutrition content as you can easily cut the butter down with the normal and still retain great taste.  The normal box is 3 servings with 4T butter, this box is 2 servings with 2T butter, so cut the normal down to 3T and you should be fairly similar.<br /><br />Taste wise I notice very little difference between the two, this veggie mac might have a slight vegi aftertaste, but nothing too offensive.  If the price per serving were closer together I would recommend this mac and cheese.  The difference in taste is nothing as strong as whole wheat vs white flour breads.<br /><br />The bottom line is this doesn't really have any significant quantity of vegetables in it, the first ingredient is enriched cauliflower pasta product, but what this means is that it is enriched wheat flour with some dried cauliflower mixed in."

One package at only 1.7oz delivers a whopping 800mg of sodium. I really like these but they have a lot going against them. They're VERY expensive. 1.7 oz is almost nothing.

I was a bit disappointed with this tea. I have a hard time tasting the coconut. The chocolate comes through, however. It depends on how much money is spent on the tin. If it is $15 for 20 satchels that is a bit pricey. Most of the other H & S teas are less than $10. I would have expected more of the coconut taste come through. One of the other reviewers thought it was strong. Well it might be for them, but I can barely taste it. I really like the taste combination in other things.

In that way they feel different when compared with other bitters, and I feel that more is needed in cocktails. They are predominantly cinnamon-flavored and do not feel as complex as I expected - I was expecting perhaps more of a charred oak flavor. Overall they are not bad, and I can certainly find some use for them, but they are priced fairly high, and I personally still prefer Angostura bitters in my Manhattans and Old Fashioneds."
456293,E. Kerby,3,"I made one of these cakes this afternoon.<br /><br />I saw another review that said that the cooking time was too long, so I was careful to check on the cake early, to be sure that I didn't overcook it.  For my cake, the recommended time seemed to be just right.<br /><br />I also made the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KUWET4"">Dr Oetker Organics Organic Chocolate Icing Mix (12x11.3 OZ)</a> to frost the cake with.<br /><br />To be honest, I was pretty unimpressed with the cake.  Even though I'm sure it was not overcooked, this cake is very dry.  To me it tastes a lot like a store-bought pre-made cake.  Even though I just made it a few hours ago, because it is dry it tastes a little stale, like a cake that is a few days old.  Or a store-bought cake.  The Dr. Oetker icing makes it somewhat better, but you have to be sure to get icing with every bite.<br /><br />It also has kind of an interesting chocolate flavor.  I think maybe the chocolate used is not from a very high quality cacao; I attended a chocolate-tasting class once, and we learned that lower-quality cacao beans are deliberately burned in processing to mask the poor quality of the chocolate.  I kind of smell and taste the burnt-cacao flavor in this cake; most people just identify that smell and taste as regular chocolate because Hersheys and other cheap chocolates all have that flavor.  Of course, just because we're purchasing an organic product does not mean that the manufacturer selects high quality cacao beans, and surely organic cacao comes in all different grades just like conventional cacao beans.  So, that is what it is.  It isn't the end of the world.  The flavor is not very rich or complex, though.<br /><br />I will say something about the mix that did impress me: it is not totally homogeneous.  Usually if you purchase a cake mix that's just a conventional one, the powder is very finely ground, and it all looks really uniform.  With this cake mix, when you pour it out of the bag, you can see the little sugar crystals, and I did like that, because it made it seem more like ""real food"".<br /><br />Honestly, if you can just mix up a homemade cake, you'll be happier with the result of that than you will with this.  If you desperately want the convenience of a cake mix, this product is okay, but not amazing."
399250,Spungehead,3,"These are about the closest thing many have found to the Carnation breakfast bar of the 70s, 80s and, I believe, the early 90s.  That classic Carnation bar (particularly the chocolate chip variety) had a flavor and consistency unmatched by any snack around.  The old ""you can't eat just one"" cliche was true for many, and these things were pretty substantial.  Thousands have signed a petition to get them back, but it's unlikely to do any good.  Anyway, back to the Quaker Chewy Dipps chocolate chip variety - they're a better substitute than most, but on their way down in quality.  The chocolate chips have become nearly non-existent, and I just noticed the ""chocolatey"" covered granola bar designation.  ""Chocolatey"" is a term food companies use when they want to consumers to believe a product contains genuine chocolate, when it actually does not.  They're still pretty tasty, but with more and more corners being cut (yes, I know chocolate is becoming more scarce and expensive), they are probably on the way out."

81897,A. DORONIO,3,"I bought this product because we originally thought our new puppy had a condition called megaesophagus which requires them to eat and stay in a vertical position for 30-45 minutes after eating and other people had recommended this product to keep the dog occupied during that time.<br />We later found that our dog doesn't have this condition (thank goodness) so I was going to return it but I decided to try it out when my puppy got a tick on her head, thinking it would keep her focused while I got the tick off (which it very much did)<br /><br />The only one I have used is the chicken flavor and when I took off the lid, I gagged and threw up in my mouth. It stinks that bad. But my puppy did seem to like the taste of it."
542238,M. Wood,3,"I was not impressed with the Chai Latte or any of the Cafe Escapes K-Cups. The flavor would have been good if there wasn't an odd after taste that I can only assume comes from artificial sweetener. A friend, who is used to diet drinks and artificial sweeteners, loved this tea and didn't notice an odd taste, hence the three stars. I added one for her because I would have only rated it two. :)"
44691,"N. Burt ""nikkles""",3,"but I guess I don't really love them together. The chocolate is not sweet at all (they also have no other flavor to them), which means I can only eat about three before I feel like their getting bitter.  It may be that their just too dark for me and they will not be too strong for someone else.  they would probably be good in a trail mix of some kind to give your taste buds some flavor variety."

363717,C. Walls,3,"Well, this product was a great disappointment.  All the fruit kinda tastes the same, except maybe the banana chips.  The fruit is very tart!!  And the pieces of fruit are too small and tend to turn into dust.  Must be a better product out there.  I am on the hunt  --"
19845,D. Hannon,3,New purchase!  Works fine but you get only little more than a half cup of coffee!! Had a Senseo that gave a full cup of coffee and tasted better!

505015,Kris,3,Bought the tea thinking oh coconut and chocolate sounds good. Tried it and the flavor is just not right. It's more a chocolate mint with a bit of coconut. I probably won't buy it again.

542366,Mike,3,"As an amateur home roaster I cannot fully recommend this product.  First the good, you get some nice varieties, nothing too exotic but fine nonetheless, some are even blended for espresso.  The sample packs are a bit under a lb, a decent amount for a home roaster and ideal for my behmor.  You even get some bonus mugs.  So far I've done some good roasts, but watch out for the blends.  I've had to actually throw away two of the blends without even trying to roast them.  The beans were just gnarly, especially one of the house blends, no excuse for that kind of quality control.  I hope other purchasers didn't get any packages like that.  I'm not saying never buy this product, but definitely beware, you can do a lot better.  If you're an amateur home roaster absolutely find a local commercial roaster, perhaps one with a small coffee shop.  They would be thrilled to sell you the raw beans at a decent price and suggest varieties, roasting methods."
230671,Banana Incident,3,"(This review is for the white can with the gold star)<br /><br />I imagine if I were to break open a battery and empty the contents into my mouth, this is exactly how it would taste and feel. It's brutal. I can't really describe it. It tastes sort of... pineapple-y? With a hint of dirty socks and metal...?<br /><br />But it has a lot of good stuff in it and really wakes me up. But the blueberry flavor (blue and white can) is 100x better.<br /><br />If you want a sugar free energy drink, get the diet Red Bulls. I can hardly taste the difference with those. But these are okay sometimes and WAY cheaper."

The difference is that the Matiz sardines in olive oil can be ordered in five-packs with free shipping (as of the time of this writing), and the Matiz product is every bit as good as this and a little easier on the salt."
295114,"wisetraveller ""wisetraveller""",3,"I trusted the reviews and went ahead and bought the 6 pack. I was curious about the taste of the tea. My first observation was the bitterness of the tea. It tasted bitter and grassy. The stevia root does not seem to help much. I can definitely smell the rose-hips in the tea while it's brewing and it's quite pleasant. I tried several seeping techniques and the only way I managed to reduce the bitterness of this tea is by brining the water to a boil and then letting it cool down at room temperature for a minute before inserting the tea bag and let it steep for just 3 minutes.<br /><br />Since I didn't buy the tea because of it's advertised benefits to the skin, I was not surprised when I didn't observe any change in my skin condition whatsoever. So far, I have been drinking 2 cups a day for the last 4 weeks. If you want to detoxify your body, drink water and eat real food. Tea doesn't really do much if your entire lifestyle is unhealthy. Eat what your grandmother ate."
359916,skysail,3,"The advantage of the micro crystals (more absorptive surface) is also it's biggest disadvantage.  The crystals are so small and light that they get tracked all over.  They also invariably get stuck in the crevasses of the cats' paws.  I am not sure whether these crystals contributed to the irritation of the paws on one of my cats.  Odor control is good until, all of a sudden, the crystals get saturated and the ammonia smell is almost impossible to get rid of.  I must say I like a natural clumping litter (like Swheat Scoop) better."
5203,"Wings42 ""David""",3,"I gave it 3 stars because of the quality ingredients. But if neither of my cats will eat it, what's the use? We tried weaning them to this food from the junk we've been feeding them by mixing and slowly increasing the amount of Felidae, or by getting them real hungry first, all to no avail. The only way they'll eat it is if we cover it with drippings from fish we cook for ourselves, or from cans of sardines.<br /><br />More than anything, I think the mushy pate type texture bothers them more that the taste, because it smells pretty good to me."
546520,J. Hale,3,"Let me preface this review by saying I love Annie Chun's products.<br /><br />That being said.. I'm not a huge fan of this specific flavor.<br /><br />Like all of the other Annie Chun products I've consumed, this one is no exception in having a nicely sized portion, excellent noodles, and being the ONLY product I've ever consumed that had dehydrated vegetables that actually tasted/felt like they were fresh once re-hydrated.<br /><br />What is keeping this from being 4-5 stars is that the Teriyaki sauce is just terrible. I truly cannot imagine how people can say it's ""delicious"". It doesn't even taste like Teriyaki. I'm eating my last bowl of it right now, and I would say the flavor just tastes like terribly seasoned soy sauce.<br /><br />Overall, I would give the noodles/veges/portion size 5 stars, and the sauce 2 stars (generously)."
132789,Gigi,3,"I used to get the Gerber fruit strips for my kids, but they were so expensive for the dinky little strips so I got Kettle Valley.  I really liked the Kettle Valley bc it had actual strawberry seeds which tells me there are actually strawberries in them (as well as one full apple).  I thought I'd try these Island ones because they were cheaper...and I've found they lack quality too.  Instead of being berry colored like the picture mine were brown.  They tasted ok, but they weren't my favorite.  Looking at the label the only benefits it had was 4% of your DV vitamin C.  I'd say they are probably better for kids than the regular sugar packed fruit strips you find in the store, but I don't think they are really worth the advertised 1/2 serving of fruit."
180274,DeeDee,3,I was hoping to find another good chew for my puppy.  Initially she wasn't too interested in it but every once in a while I'll catch her gnawing on it.  She's a small dog and I'd think that this is a little too big for her but she has a few bully sticks almost as thick (she definitely likes them better).
244963,Blue Cat,3,"I love soymilk and thought this was a good way to save on $$$..however after a few weeks of trying this product by adding to coffee/tea (which is my primary use of soymilk), I can't drink it anymore.. The flavor is a little too ""strong"" for me, i think it tastes more like Vanilla rather than Plain...(can't stand vanilla)<br /><br />Will go back to buying liquid/fresh soymilk."
552217,Wes,3,"This product claims to have ""50% more caffeine"" than whatever else you can find in a canned coffee drink. Maybe this is true, but I have to say that based on the several cans I've consumed, a strong buzz failed to materialize. As far as taste goes, it's passable. The colder it is served the better; it gets less palatable as it adjusts to room temperature. The drink consistency is thin, not as ""rich"" as the Starbucks doubleshot if that matters to you. It's too bad Amazon doesn't offer Doubleshot by the case - and at a discounted price - as it does this item. I'd order that before I would pick up ""Shock"" Coffee."
86712,John Krehnovi,3,"I love the flavor of this gum and I love that it is healthy.  All 5 flavors taste great to me.  I think the price is also great.<br /><br />That being said, I will be trying other brands and options before buying this again.  The flavor lasts right around 30-45 seconds of normal chewing.  I usually pop in a new piece every few minutes depending upon my mood.  Sometimes I'll chew up to 10 pieces in a 30 minute timeframe.  I like to have flavor for at least a few minutes and this gum does not do this.<br /><br />Initially when I tried these, I would have given them 4 or 5 stars.  But now that I'm so used to the flavor disappearing on me quickly, 3 stars is the perfect rating for me.<br /><br />I would maybe buy again.  But I'll be trying some mints and other brands before I do this."
146706,zelda999,3,"This is the second time I've ordered these cookies. The flavor is very good, and I cannot purchase these locally.<br />I was a little disappointed because, both times it seems as though the box was stored or shipped in too much heat. All the cookies are stuck together, and the chocolate seemed a little old because it was whitish and grainy.<br />I still enjoy them, but I just wish they looked like they do in the picture on the box."
417129,nicewatch,3,Pretty much tastes like dirt. I bought this based on a friends recommendation. After buying and mentioning the taste he said he forgot to tell me he gets the chocolate flavored. There you have it... Get the chocolate.
242533,Eddie Wannabee,3,"Bought them when they first came out. Somewhere around August 2009?  Went a little ""nutty"" and expecting them to be great and using the offer Atkins was offering pre-release, I purchased 3 bags. Wanted to love them, as a matter of fact. Found the texture too ""gritty"" for my complete approval and a somewhat of an after taste. Not very pronounced but present, never the less. The main purpose was to be able to enjoy tasty pancakes with less guilt but in the end, after trying to make biscuits one day, I had to ask help from my old buddy Bisquick. Bisquick basically said to me: ""I understand your frustration but why don't you add one cup of that Atkins Mix and two cups of me plus eggs and see how that goes?"". I admit it is unusual to be having a conversation with a box of bisquick but in this case I did not regret the sound advice. The quality improved immediately, waffles or pancakes, and now all I had to worry about was finding out a (real difficult to find) perfect sugar free syrup to match the serving of pancakes (traditionally every Saturday morning) but that is another story and frankly all this talk about pancakes is making me eye the refrigerator way more that I would like to at this time. 3 Stars for the idea is commendable. Regretfully, on the practice, this baking mix is not as good as it probably could have been? Must say that Atkins has pulled through several times for me and their products are always excellent alternatives with a whole less sugar. See? I am not badmouthing anyone that didn't have it coming!"
21971,Norma F,3,"We bought this for our dog as a way to feed him his kibble and entertain him for about 20 minutes a day at the same time. Out of the box, it took him about 10 minutes to figure it out and empty it of the 1 1/2 cups of small kibble. If we fed larger kibble, it might take longer. But because I had read other reviews, I knew this to be the case and followed the advice of others on here. I added some <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CSAJ96"">small tennis balls</a> to the jug and then threw the kibble in on top of it. That helped in 2 ways. First, the kibble didn't spill out of the neck while I was filling it from the bottom. Second, it slowed down the amount of time it took our dog to empty it (about half an hour).<br /><br />Just a word of warning: you will have kibble all over your floor until the dog goes back to eat it up. Ours is pretty good about going back to clean up after himself but you have to have patience that he will do that."

257253,J. W. McGhee,3,"Ever since I was a young lad, I can remember using Dove products in the shower. Dove bar soap has always been a mainstay in my routine. Then a few years ago I tried Dove's body wash. Great products all -- moisturizing, rich and without overpowering scent. I'd always hoped that Dove would introduce its products for men, perhaps with more masculine scents and packaging. Finally, Dove introduced its Men+Care line.<br /><br />I've tried out just about every body wash in the line and unfortunately, these are nothing like the ""unisex"" Dove body washes. The men's line is like any other typical gel you'd find among the Old Spices and Irish Springs of the pharmacy aisle. This product does little to moisturize, it's hard to squeeze out of the bottle (there's a very small opening and the plastic walls of the bottle are thick and rigid) and it doesn't wash off cleanly.<br /><br />Dove's standard body washes are thicker and richer. They are also far more moisturizing thanks to Dove's Nutrium Moisture system. The men's line does not have Nutrium Moisture. So unless you've just absolutely got to use products that say ""for men"" on the bottle, I'd stick with Dove's unisex line."

Please don't order this product if you are expecting organic."
158702,Alexis F.,3,"I bought Pure Cosmetics Coffee Bean Eye Cream back in May 2011, took a month's break from it in Sept, but have gone back to it. The results weren't mind-blowing when I was using it daily from May through mid-September, but I used it anyway because it's better than nothing. To be honest, I like how it moisturizes better than other eye creams and gels that I've used. I apply it under concealer for hydration and protection from whatever stressful effects cosmetics and living/working in NYC has had on my dry-to-sensitive skin. I used it without make-up for most of the summer to give my skin a break, but I saw no firming or brightening effects... just moisturized/hydrated. As I stated before, it's better than nothing.<br /><br />The ""coffee bean"" scent is indescribably NOT coffee, cookie, or cocoa... maybe a light version of a box of soggy waffle cones? I highly recommend you smell this at a store before you buy it. It's a super soft and creamy scent, yes, but still distinct and unappealing to me. It's basically become a general and accepted reflex to hold my breath for the few seconds I dab this on. I'm still using it because its moisturizing ways are worth it. Plus, I love the pump... it's a welcome relief from jars and tubes.<br /><br />I don't expect results from this, now that I've gone back to using it, but it feels good under my eyes: no irritation, whatsoever (i.e. my eyes don't water or itch when I dab it on my skin); moisturizing/hydrating; and very light and smooth.<br /><br />Basically: It's better than what I've previously used. However, no life-changing results... but better than nothing."
36787,D. Fowler,3,"I bought these because I heard that Thai Kitchen uses BPA.

450959,Alexander Lucard,3,"I'm always looking for alternate sources of quick protein over meat, so I decided to give a box of these Triple Nut bars a try. While not bad, the bars taste a bit over-roasted and sometimes bitter. I was also put off by how much saturated fat and sodium were in these bars. I never put extra salt on my foodstuff, so I have to admit I was a bit taken aback by how salty these were. Generally you eat granola bar type products on a run or hike. These things will dehyrdrate you pretty quickly, so the target audience is a bit out of luck here. Maybe they would work better as a snack for a work or school lunch.<br /><br />I'm also put off by the sheer amount of corn syrup in here. Corn Syrup is one of the worst things you can put in your body, making this a pretty bad option for those looking for something healthy.<br /><br />The bars taste okay, but they're neither worth the cost nor very good for you. I'd search out a healthier corn syrup free alternative if I were you."
49374,Sledman,3,"I got these when I was on the Atkins diet as a snack. They are very cheesy, and very very salty. At first they were delicious , especially after eating low carb for a few weeks. They have a great crunch, and are lightly seasoned. But after 4-5 bags they started to make me nauseous, just to rich and salty. The bags are very small, but since the chips/pucks are so rich I couldn't imagine eating more then whats in each bag in one serving."

552400,"Mister Quickly ""Amazon epicurean""",3,"Toothpicks really make me sentimental. I remember well my first toothpick, ""Gabriel."" An admirable piece of wood, so graceful in the ways of dislodging food from between ones teeth, his dance like the effortless grace of a Darcey Bussell. Alas, I was but a child and misused Gabriel, splintering him on an unprincipled frog bone snagged between my first and second premolars. I will never forget Gabriel. On the someteenth anniversary of his removal of a very recalcitrant pomegranate seed I decided to peruse Amazon for a replacement. I was suprised at the results.<br /><br />This product advertises itself as ""low-in-fat, high-in-taste."" This is marvellous because I am on a diet. A good majority of us lack the digestive enzymes necessary to process wood. Although, my colleague Gareth Mitchell Headgraves is a rarity. I admit I become anxious when I leave himself alone in a room with a good piece of teak. In any case, despite a few misguided efforts, I cannot digest wood and will reaffirm that for most of us this product is low in fat.<br /><br />After trying this product I became intruiged by a fellow reviewer's suggestion to try making your own home brew cinammon sticks. His have been brewing for 29 years. This engorged my curiousity. What flavours could I impregnate a toothpick with? Could I try a sweet Canary wine? Or a supple juniper extract? Perhaps a melegueta pepper?<br /><br />3 stars because this product only opened up my curiousity for new toothpick flavours, and now find cinnamon to be lacking.<br /><br />PS - fortunately for the parsimonious among us, Amazon has this item listed as used."

My biggest disappointment remains that this company along with many others continues to use BPA in the lining of the cans. There are other options out there that do not contain BPA but they cost a bit more. I think if more people realized you are ingesting a chemical compound that was tested to be used as female hormone replacement therapy, more people would avoid cans with these type liners. I know there is no ""definitive proof"" and opinions vary on whether it actually effects cancer rates, but think how breast cancer rates have sky rocketed.

It's definitely a lighter choice than some lattes from my favorite coffee place.<br /><br />If you enjoy strong coffee taste without all the extra bells and whistles, you might enjoy this as well. If you prefer something sweet with just a hint of coffee flavor, you might want to look elsewhere. This is some strong stuff."
397412,TheShef,3,"...I would go with something else.  Check the price, this Kellogg's cereal is over $4 a 12-oz box, even at the current Amazon sale price if you have to pay shipping.<br /> I picked up a box at Kroger this week and it was over $4.  Don't necessarily like to see the BHT but I'm not alarmist about it.  As long as we eat GF, my kids and I are certainly healthy enough for a little detox.  My problem: there is nothing about this cereal to justify the high price!  The flavor is just flat - they didn't even substitute the signature malt flavoring with some rice malt syrup.  This has got to be made nearly as cheaply as regular rice krispies - I feel like many companies slap on a ""gluten free"" label and think that justifies a hefty price.  (Kudos to the Chex brand for NOT doing this.)  I don't buy many convenience foods and I don't allow my kids to eat cereal very often so I will probably only buy these on special occasions when we want Rice Krispies Treats - the real deal, because I haven't found a single ""health food"" version of crispy rice cereal that has that same crispy (not crunchy,) airy, slightly flattened shape and texture that really make a good crispy treat."
400362,"Steve H ""books911""",3,"Barilla's new pantry Mezze Penne products are an exciting lineup.  You can enjoy a hot pasta meal in 60 seconds.  Furthermore, the product stores at room temperature, which allows you to take it to work to use in a work microwave, or to have it shipped from a store like Amazon.com without worry in most climates.<br /><br />The pasta sauce is stored in a bin above the pasta.  To prepare the meal, you peal back the top seal to expose the sauce and allow ventilation.  You heat it for 60 seconds.  Let it cool, remove the rest of the seal carefully, pour the sauce on the pasta, transfer it to a plate should you wish, and eat!  It's fast, and it is simple.  No refrigeration required.  It truly is a nifty idea.<br /><br />The only downside is that they are not the tastiest products.  I have tried the Tomato & Basic, Marina, and Spicy Marina.  It's extremely difficult for me to tell a difference between any of the sauces.  The sauces are not great.  Just ok.<br /><br />In terms of the pasta, it comes out slightly gooey and not as soft as it could be.  Just ok.<br /><br />Overall, a brilliant idea.  With the great storage ability, it's not bad to have one or two of these on hand for a long work day, when you want a simple lunch or dinner fast.  However, in general, I would not want to consume these on a daily basis.  Perhaps, over time, they will keep getting better, improve this product.  If they could include just a slightly higher quality sauce and pasta, it could be a real winner.  Right now, just ok."

137114,"Lois Wilson ""dog lover""",3,"I have five dogs and have been feeding both the medium and large sizes of this product for several months.  I have no doubt that it cleans their teeth.  However, I have two problems with this product.  One is with the sizing.  In the large size, there are always plenty of chews that should be considered medium.  Since I pay extra for the large size, I expect that they should all be large.  Also, there are often ones included that are way too thick, and can't be chewed in a reasonable time.<br />The other problem is with my old black lab mix, Fargo.  He chews for awhile and then proceeds to swallow the whole thing.  Invariably, it gets caught in his throat and I have to fish it out.  He resents this as he believes I am trying to steal it.  I have discontinued using these and am looking for another product that works equally well but is less apt to be swallowed whole."
22919,"K. E. Steelman ""mommarock""",3,"Okay, I'll admit it.... I am a coffee snob.  I have loved coffee since I was old enough to steal a sip from my parents' cup at the breakfast table... and that was too many years ago for me to tell you here.  That said, I will tell you that this coffee is weak and lacks flavor, no matter how strongly it is brewed.  I tried several pots and was not satisfied with even one of them.  I love a dark roasted, full flavored coffee and have tried many French Roasts, which this is 'supposed' to be.  It was dull and flatter than any generic decaf and truly unappealing to me.  I would rather have one cup of 'good' coffee than pots of mediocre brew.<br /><br />This is a coffee that left me feeling as if I had drank a coffee substitute and not even a good one at that.  If you are looking for low acid coffee, try a good Ethiopian or one of the many naturally less acidic coffees out there and pass this one by.  It left me totally lacking in coffee satisfaction.  The aroma was wonderful in the pot, but the taste was of the 'brown water' variety.  It needs work in my opinion."

The Santa Fe Fat Free, Vegetarian Refried Beans only have 210mg of sodium per serving and have a great taste....I highly recommend these instead of the Southwestern Style!!

It reminded me a lot of the coffee I sometimes have to have when the family all wants to stop at Mcdonalds for breakfast. I also found that the coffee pods/K-cup quickly lost its freshness after two days. I had it inside an air tight container but soon after a couple of days the freshness was gone and the aroma of the coffee smelled like the can of Folgers that my mother-in-law has on her shelf. They also make a french roast which I thought was OK. But again, a bit weak for a french roast coffee. The french roast coffee, as was with the fog chaser,after a couple of days, soon lost its flavor and the aroma became ""Folgers coffee"" like. I guess the packaging makes a difference. In conclusion, I do not think I will be purchasing this again."

Yes, that's sweet, but I've seen cereals with more than that.<br /><br />I don't think it tastes like s'mores at all, just generic sweet chocolaty cereal with dehydrated marshmallows.

168955,Yogafreedom,3,"Sambazon Acai Powerscoop Powder 90g from Sambazon<br /><br />As a person with an auto-immune disease, where chronic fatigue is a major obstacle, I have navigated through many nutritional support options to supplement a healthy diet and when I first began to read about the Acai Berry, I was interested in trying it. I have used other anti-oxidant products from very dependable sources, and there is just no dramatic difference I detect with this product. Freeze dried Acai appears to be the most dependable formulation for delivery of the benefits of the berry, but I honestly noticed no change after a month trial. (I actually had to stop taking this product for a few days as for some reason, perhaps attributed to the pH of the supplement, I found the product worsened my gastritis). I give the product three stars, because I do believe that for some people, they may see remarkable results, but I certainly did not. I still believe that this product is worth a try, for all the reasons that the Acai Berry has the potential to yield wonderful changes in overall health. It just did not do it for me. Good luck to those who choose to try this. I would recommend this brand because of the preference of the freeze dried state to hold onto all the nutritional ""miracles"". Don't get succored into cheaper brands. The nature of a complicated illness may or may not be a factor that determines clinical outcomes. Healthy supplement options are at times only as good as the Company that makes them. I do believe that the Acai Berry is a very important food souce. Besides the wonders of its potential health benefits, it is a product that ensures the preservation of the Amazon Jungles. On the flip-side, the less we eat hearts of palms which comes from the same tree and literally ensures the destruction of the tree to harvest the hearts, the better."

This is the first one that upon trying a sip, I had an overwhelming taste of licorice, not bergamot.  Since I am not a fan of licorice, it wasn't a pleasant discovery.  Thankfully, the taste does 'mellow' out after a few more sips to a more 'Earl Grey' flavor, the bergamot becoming more prominent, but it's not the strongest cup of Earl Grey that I've ever had.  I'm keeping in mind that people can have different reactions to flavor and will probably offer this to friends who enjoy licorice more than I do."

59617,"Avid Camper ""WS""",3,"Tried this, recently, (in all dry flavors) for my German Shepherd Dog.  At first, he wouldn't touch it, but after about a week, he decided he absolutely loves it.  The biggest problem is within the first month, he had gained 3 pounds, even though he was eating less than the recommended amount and less than he was previously used to eating.  Also, he had soft, oily looking stools while eating this.  He is an active, very healthy, well-exercised, older dog.  He did seem to be more ""chipper"" and health-wise, he seemed to do fine, except for the softer stools and weight gain, but reluctantly, we had to stop feeding this, exclusively, as we were feeding less and less and he was still gaining weight AND seemed hungry all the time, looking for any other food to eat.  Since he loves the taste so much, we have decided to give him only a cup or so a day, in his Kong, with his other food or as training treats and have switched him to another food.  I'm not sure I agree with the ""good for all life stages"" philosophy either.  In the old days, that was what one did, but now that we know much more about nutrition, I believe that different life stages do require different nutrient levels.  Much as humans do.  Sadly, for our dog, this can not be the only food he eats, but it will remain a part of his daily diet, since he loves it and did well, except for the fat content.  Hope this helps!"

If you put in the same quantities as regular coffee, it will turn out like syrup."

402236,"Goldwave ""shopper""",3,"Well, I guessed that a product marketed as being ""three-cheese"" flavored would taste reasonably cheese-like.  If I'd been given this in a blind taste-test, I'm unsure I would have even identified it as supposing to be a cheese-flavored product.  It's really, really bland.<br /><br />There's nothing inherently wrong with ""bland"" if that's what you are after.  Bland obviously is want one wants for a base for other things, for example.  But the marketing on this product seems deceptive to me.  It is sold as a ""meal in a bowl"" (suggesting it's not just a base, but a fully seasoned dish).  I specifically ordered it because I was looking for a quick way to make some basic cheesy pasta, and the product (and reviews) suggest that this is meant to be a cheese flavored item.  If it was marketed as ""pasta in a mild, light sauce with a hint of cheese flavor"", then I wouldn't have ordered it, because that wasn't what I was looking for.  I can see that someone might be looking for something like that; but in any event, that's not the implication from the packaging.<br /><br />I don't like dissing this product because it sounds like a number of people find it convenient, like the flavor, and want to be able to keep ordering it.  So I would say, as long as you understand that this a very gently flavored item, of predictably low quality pasta, and that will suit your purposes, great.  I appreciate honest reviews that others leave of their opinions, since it helps me figure out what I might like that I haven't tried yet.  We all have different tastes and needs for products, so I hope this review helps those who were thinking along the lines that I was when ordering this."

It definitely tastes and feels better than some ""healthy"" pastas available, but I'm just not sold on this. If you want low net carbs and that's your main goal, definitely use this and add in meats, veggies, and cheese to your dish for a good meal."

327911,"Neil Santana ""Rock Aficionado""",3,"Not bad for a pre-workout supplement I guess. I've had better though. It does nothing to increase strength or endurance in my opinion. It does however, make you feel like you CAN do more, even though when you try, you can't. I feel focused and energetic if I take this lilke an hour before the workout. I still get winded quickly though, and I don't see any strength gains (It's only been two weeks though).<br /><br />When you mix it, it smells horrible. Like somebody stuffed old cheese in a dirty gym sock, then hosed it down with raspberry perfume. Then beat you upside the head with it. It's actually embarassing to mix in my office because my co workers can smell it. Lucky for BSN, the taste isn't nearly as bad. Though I wouldn't say it's ""great"". It almost tastes carbonated as well.<br /><br />Also, for about the first week, you'll most likely go through an adjustment period. This stuff goes right through you. Like literally 15 minutes into drinking it, you'll feel like you're going to crap your pants. In fact, if you're not careful, you just might. I feel like I may crap my pants right now as I write this. And I just started drinking it. You get used to it, but the first week is kinda miserable. It makes your stomach ache and growl.<br /><br />I dunno, for the price, not bad. package is a lot smaller than I expected, but the servings are a lot smaller than I expected too.<br /><br />I've tried N.O. Xplode, which I prefer to this stuff. N.O. Xplode makes you hyper but has kinda the same adjustment period."

Didn't like that for the price I paid"
39345,S. J. Martin,3,"I bought these to try as a lower fat alternative to peanuts. I found the taste to be bland and chalky. What it does have going for it: it's an organic product, and the pre-portioned one ounce bags are convenient to carry in a purse or bag. It's high in protein and low in fat. I couldn't really taste the sea salt flavor though."
211027,mj,3,"We got this for dog training rather than camping. The shipping was fast and the product was fine. They are a little brittle and one tube already broke but I'm not sure whether that is a function of the tube design or how we were using it. In all fairness, we were using it for dog training and keep it in the fridge while not being used so that might have had something to do with the cracking. Otherwise, these tubes are great for many different foods and uses. We'll probably get more for camping."

I always toast mine and add some Smart Balance spread and a slight amount of honey and I look forward to eating it every day.  I buy from six to twelve loaves at a time so I don't run out and place it in the freezor even though the company doesn't recommend it.

So I was looking for a nice flavored variety and decided to try this out.<br />The taste is where I had a problem with this. It's sweet enough, but the cinnamon seems to leave a bit of an after taste. That's the main reason I'm rating this lower.<br />Otherwise, it's pretty good. The size of the bites is nice - I like that it's smaller. You can control better how much you want to serve.<br />Maybe I'm being a little too picky with the taste. So I would recommend trying it out to see for yourself."

My dogs loved the taste, and I felt really good about feeding them something with an ingredient list that talked about organic ingredients.  However, neither of my dogs tolerated these well.  If your dog has a sensitive stomach, this might not be the dog biscuit for you.<br /><br />Just for reference, I have an older full-breed corgi and a younger corgi/chihuaha mix.  My older dog has definitely developed gluten and corn allergies over the years, while the corgi mix just has a sensitive tummy.  That's probably why they couldn't tolerate these--it's not the fault of the ingredients."

It's what years ago we used to refer to in the food-service business as ""dissected"" coconut -- grated, yes, shredded, no. I've used many Bob's Red Mill products and liked them all.

543968,"fair_deal_guy ""BB""",3,"If people bought ""energy"" drinks solely on the basis of taste, the market for these products would shrink pretty quickly because most of these drinks have no definable taste profile and mostly taste like diluted Kook-aid. Fortunately for companies like the aptly named Vitamin Squeeze, buyers have been so conditioned by the giant beverage companies (e.g., Gatorade, Coke, Pepsi, etc.) to accept gawdawful concoctions falsely marketed as ""flavors"" that what the product actually tastes like is of little or no concern when the purchase decision is made.<br /><br />It's hard to tell what the makers of ""Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink"" want you to think of their product. The product description suggests this is an energy/vitamin drink that will enhance your health. The packaging and flavor descriptions (e.g., ""fruit punch"") suggest this stuff is a kids' drink along the lines of Kool-aid injected with a jolt of caffiene.<br /><br />I tried to ignore the marketing buzzwords completely and focus on the taste and the convenience factor. In terms of taste, if you ignore the flavor listed on the label, you'll have a tough time describing what this product actually tastes like. It's definitely not fruit, and it doesn't taste like any punch I'd consume. I'd say it tastes kind of sweet and mostly artificial. It's drinkable, as long as your expectations are very low and you're OK with a drink that is red and sweet and not much more.<br /><br />The packaging is pretty cool, though, and portioning is easy - which is why a product like this exists. Just fill an empty bottle with water, squeeze in a little concentrate, shake, and you've got a cheap energy drink in seconds.<br /><br />If Vitamin Squeeze can produce a drink that tastes like something grown, not manufactured, I'd have this stuff stacked to the ceiling in my pantry. Until then, I'll pass."

So if you were ordering this on a regular basis you would be the proud owner of many styrofoam cooler containers... I'm not sure what to do with the one.  I know it comes frozen but it seems like there must be something out there other than styrofoam, honestly shouldn't the stuff be banned already?  My older two kids and I had a great time with the dry ice however.<br /><br />The baby does like the food so far.  Frozen instead of jars is an interesting idea, although I think I will freeze my own and continue to use my processor to process what we are eating for her and keep jars for emergencies."
147697,karen harris,3,"This was my first time trying this brew of Kcup. It is ok, but the flavor is a bit acidic. I like a bold brew, even though I do add cream and Equal. When using this Kcup, I found I used at least one extra sweetener packet and twice the half & half. Friends of mine have enjoyed this flavor, however.<br /><br />I'd like to find a brand of kcup that is similar to Newman's Own, extra bold.  I have found this brand on Amazon, but it is through outside sellers, so not eligible for subscribe & save. The price through these vendors is also nearly twice the price of most of the kcups offered on amazon.

353633,Ed,3,"Barb:  I was first introduced to a Mojito about 12 years ago.  It was delicious!  Haven't had one since, probably because they seem to be so labor-intensive to make, with all that muddling of the mint leaves, etc.  So, I was curious about the Mojito drink offered by Crystal Light Mocktail line from Kraft foods.  The pitcher of Mojito drink that I whipped up was interesting, though it seemed a little on the weak side.  It was a strange green color, but there was a nice lime and minty flavor, kind of reminiscent of the one I had so long ago!  But the one big downfall for me was that pesky aftertaste of Aspartame!  Unfortunately, I have to watch my calorie/sugar intake now, so I'll be trying to get my tastebuds to accept that terrible aftertaste.  Unless Kraft foods Co. is willing to change the formula to use one of the other accepted sweeteners on the market...hint, hint."
66551,Cyndijp,3,"I order this product after seeing a segment on a National news program. With the new trend of coupling sea salt and various flavors I was excited to try this product. I gave a bag to my parents before I tried it, they really like caramel. They did not respond with the enthusiasm I expected. They said they would have never known there was salt if I hadn't told them. So then I tried a bag. I feel the same. Maybe I was expecting more. But the picture on the front of the kernel with Sea Salt and the kernels in the bag didn't match. The popcorn itself was crisp with a good caramel flavor but I would have liked a bit more salt granules added. Save your money, purchase regular Caramel Corn at the grocers."
252771,Pip,3,I love See's peanut brittle.  I thought this would be as good because it has almonds but it seems like all I can taste is the sugar brittle part.  I can see the almonds but I can't taste it.  Perhaps almonds don't make a good brittle.

That said, they are what they are and they are great for regularity and great to send as gifts - dried California organic fruit.<br /><br />I should say I am used to slab 'cots from casa de fruta, and these do not resemble in any way those dried 'cots even though they use sulfur dioxide, they are juicier and sweeter and taste like apricots.  Even Casa de Fruta's basic 'cots taste better than these.  I ordered on subscription, but will cancel today and have at least 4-6 gifts for Christmas already."

18021,Meredith Parrish,3,"This is a tricky product to review.  On the one hand, the flavor is great! (especially the choc. peanut butter).  If I were rating it on flavor alone, I would give it five stars.  However, I took one star off for the price and another star off for the quantity.  It has 15 servings, with each serving being two Tablespoons.  however, two tablespoons of the powder mixed with a little water only yields about 2 teaspoons of peanut butter.  So if you are making peanut butter for a sandwich or for apples, you go through the jar pretty quick (only took me about two days).  But if you are going to add it to a vanilla protein shake, the one serving adds a ton of flavor.  So I would repurchase this but only for adding to shakes."

I followed the directions as indicated on the box and even after 15 minutes they were still a little hard.

Not to mention that it didn't taste like parmesan cheese. I wouldn't buy it again.
265043,"J. R. Smith - Upland, Ca.",3,I gave this product one star the first time around but I think I figured it out so I'm now giving it three stars.  When I first received the 6-pack of this tea and opened it up it smelled like sewer sludge. The expiration date is over 2 & 1/2 years away so perhaps this is a very fresh shipment.  After a day on the countertop the smell subsided quit a bit. I poured the boiling water over a bag and let it set for about five minutes.  When I placed my honker over the cup its smell was still very strong but it also started to subside very quickly.<br /><br />The taste reminded me of dirt so I gave it a packet of stevia which made it drinkable unlike the first time I made this tea.  I was surprised at the smell and taste after about half way through the cup.  It now seems very pleasant and drinkable.  I might move it up another star or two after I get use to it.
309076,teagrl,3,"I bought this product because it appears that the teabag version of the Pixie mate chai (all of Pixie's teas actually) are no longer being made or sold and it was my favorite drink.  I do not particularly like things that are extremely sweetened so it has been difficult to find the right balance with this concentrate.  It is not bad, it is not great either.  It is extremely sweet as it has the sugar already in it.  The directions recommend mixing half concentrate with half milk and heating.  I found this to be overwhelmingly sweet and thick so I use 1/3 concentrate 2/3 almond milk (which is less sweet even than milk) and sometimes dilute with water a bit as well.  Note this does NOT taste good diluted with just water.<br /><br />If you like things that are very sweet you will love this.  If you find where they are still selling the teabag version please post!"

I am looking (note present tense) for a graham cracker that is organic, and these taste fair but the big ding comes from them not being %100 organic; the description did say %74, to be fair.  For $1.50, I can get the  14 ounce store brand box of graham crackers that use graham flour, and save some money if I'm not getting a truly organic product. YES, most of the ingredients are organic.... but one turd in a pool sends everyone running for the deck.  BUT, they are GMO-free- and that does help somewhat.<br /><br />The flavor.  Hmmm.  Well, they're OK.  I'll use up what I got. Maybe.  There is a mild cinnamon flavor that isn't awful, but not what I wanted. I like cinnamon, but I wanted more of a honey graham flavor. The texture isn't really 'crisp' either.  They're not soggy, but it wouldn't take much to make them soggy if they were used in something like a pudding dessert.  I won't reorder them.  For a natural product, there's a funny flavor and aftertaste.  Glad I got the Xylitol gum in this order to kill the aftertaste."

377263,B. Scalise,3,"I guess my taste-buds just aren't like those of most.  I don't find this confection worthy of the high ratings others give.<br /><br />It's an okay confection.  Not horrible, not sublime, average.<br /><br />These circles are about the size of a $0.25 piece, have a yellow/peach alternating color scheme, and are covered with granulated sugar.  There's so much sugar that there are piles of it at the bottom of the bag.<br /><br />The texture is much softer than a traditional ""gummi"" product, and much softer than Hairbo's other ""gummi"" products.  After you open the bag, the confection starts to lose its softness quickly, so be prepared to eat the entire bag upon opening.  As a last resort, some sort of container that can be closed to the outside air, like a zip-lock bag, could be employed.  After eating about 2 lbs I started to feel full, and in a hyper-glycemic episode, broke down and put the remaining 3 lbs in a zip-lock bag.<br /><br />This confection is also very sweet.  If you are one that likes their ""sweets"" only partially so, this will probably be too sweet.<br /><br />If you're looking for an inexpensive, peach-flavored, very sweet treat, these are a good choice.  Just don't expect a life-changing, 5-star confection."

However, the preparation directions were for a double serving which caught me off guard.  While it tasted fine, it gave me too many carbs and sugars and being diabetic, this was upsetting.<br /><br />Hodgson Mills should be consistent with serving size and preparation.  I looked at 2 other hot cereals from them  that I use and they are using serving for the preparation so there is no confusion.<br /><br />I emailed them but so far no response."
226816,T. Kunikov,3,"Definitely for those who like chocolate.  If you're not a huge fan of chocolate, you will probably want to give this product a pass.  It tastes good enough but is nothing special.  It actually tastes better after being in milk for a minute or so, better soggy than crunchy.  You'll most likely be eating more than the 3/4s cup that's listed on the side, so take that information with a grain of salt.  Double it and that's probably your breakfast, some 300+ calories but you'll be getting a good amount of nutrients with it."
387774,amazonbuyer,3,"I love this tea and will be purchasing it again. But I do not brew it alone. I brew it with Tazo's Chai to balance out the flavor. I also add extra green cardamom seeds, freshly ground pepper, ginger, and star anise. So as a tea all by itself, this wouldn't do it for me. But it makes a perfect balance with the Tazo Chai and all the other spices I throw in.<br /><br />After the tea is all brewed I do add honey & whole milk. The milk eliminates any bitterness."

Well, that proved to be what did it for me. Yes, I loooved it when savored in that manner<br /><br />I shared it with a friend who is more of a connoisseur than I am, and he loved it...straight from the stylish, golden wrapper.<br /><br />Another drawback for me is the expensive price. This 2.25-oz. size isn't available yet, but I found Newman's other same-size bars on Amazon for $26.88 per box of twelve. That works out to about $2.50 per candy bar (plus postage).

The sachets were so fresh and had such an essence of peppermint without any bitterness (even when a little over-steeped).  Even the smell of a cup of tea from the sachet felt pepperminty in scent and sensation.  However, the bags just don't do the tea justice.  Not only does tea from the bags, as opposed to the sachets not stand out as a peppermint tea, but also they actually have a sort of bleached water aftertaste.  I say this probably and only in comparison to the Harney & Sons sachets.  Get the sachets.  If you are a lover of peppermint tea, you'll dream about this tea from the sachet."

I bought this tea since it has extra antioxidants in it but to be honest the taste is a bit odd to me. I believe the lemongrass overpowers the taste of the tea. Just an FYI in case you are not too keen on the taste of lemongrass. I prefer Numi green tea w. toasted rice simply because I think the true green tea taste shines through more. I also noticed that this tea does give me more of a caffeine kick than the numi tea. Not a bad tea just not what I expected."

I disproved that immediately, while trying to remove the bubble wrap form the single can Vine offered, the knife went a millimeter too deep and made a nice scratch in the can, which immediately burst. I slapped into a containment glass, but it is the Vine's way of rarely offering enough of a food or beverage for the reviewer to form an honest and well considered opinion.<br /><br />OK, ok, I know that's not what they meant by ""toughest drink"", but I was unaware that was a quality anyone would ever seek in an energy drink.<br /><br />As it stands, I am not very well acquainted with this style of beverage anyway, while I saw them mainly as hangover cures, I guess many regular users see them as an important part of their intake of vitamins and minerals. And Taurine and the other raft of fairly obscure supplements. And often caffeine, although my label was somewhat damaged and I couldn't quite make out the rather extensive list of ingredients. I suspect this is of little interest to the average user in any case.<br /><br />I happened to be pretty beat the day it arrived, and didn't even want to stop for a Five Hour Energy- my usually dependable source of a brief respite from fatigue- so it was a perfect time to try it out.

But after going through several long nights, and her screaming bloody murder before she'd potty (she went two days without going potty), her doctor switched over to this formula.  She never spit up and she burped much easier on this. She started pooping 2-3 times a day. Although it was still hard balls, she didn't scream and it didn't smell as bad. Her dr. said she's still constipated and that is why her poop is so hard. So they have switched her yet again to the natural cultures in the green can. She's only been on it for 24 hours and has already started showing gas signs and has been spitting up all evening. Not sure if she just needs time to adjust or what.

I had previously been feeding my dogs (2 small Chihuahuas) Iams and Purina Beneful (until I realized that's junk food).  At first they seemed to like Nature's Variety.  I did notice that their stools were loose sometimes--probably because it was new or rich.  I decided to buy Kirkland dog food at Costco (much cheaper at 27 bucks for a 40 pound bag, and rated 4-stars, so not as good as Nature's Variety, but still very good).  I filled half their dish with Nature's Variety and half with Kirkland, and they ate the Kirkland and left the Nature's Variety.  So, I gave the Nature's Variety to a coworker.<br /><br />I really like the fact that Nature's Variety comes in so many flavors.  Kirkland has 2 varieties: chicken, and lamb.  But that's okay.  I got one bag of each, so they can have a change of food every week or so.  With Kirkland, no loose stools and everyone is happy.  And I feel good knowing that my dogs are eating healthy food.<br /><br />PS: If you Google ""dog food advisor"", then you will find a website that ranks almost all dog foods.  I found this to be very helpful when deciding what food to buy for my dogs.  To find the Costco brand, Google ""kirkland signature pet food""."

They both have almost the same ingredients (citrus vs passion fruit in this case) and have almost the exact number of carbs and sugar.  The differences between them are the CHANTEA has a much richer tea flavor vs the Lipton.  If you are a green tea lover you would certainly prefer this over the other brands. The aloe pulp may put people off but, I liked it.  I also drink orange juice with pulp so maybe thats why. I didnt love the passion fruit but will definitely try the other flavors. The other major difference is the price.  A 24 pack of Lipton green tea with citrus is about .50 a bottle (16.9oz) vs the CHANTEA which comes in 8 packs at about 2.00 each (11.5oz).<br /><br />Pros- The flavor is much richer and closer to real green tea. I would classify this as a more grown up tea drink.<br />Cons- The price is much higher than other comparable brands.<br /><br />If you go to Starbucks for your daily iced tea this would be a value for you.  If, like me, you buy a case of a similar product and are ok with the taste, this probably would not appeal to you."
563059,"Kathlyn Storey ""Kathlyn A Storey""",3,"Generally, these Quaker oatmeal cookies were a disappointment.  The major positive is that the first ingredient listed is whole grain oat flour.  Other pluses are that the cookie is not particularly sweet, individually wrapped, and it is soft, but not crumbly.  My husband and I tried these cookies for dessert last night.  The first issue was that they are 170 calories each, meaning we only had one, even though their size is not particularly large, around 3 inches in diameter.  Second, the overall taste and texture impression of the cookie is that it is commercially made; it will not remotely remind you of homemade.  Third, and personally, there are not enough raisins.  Finally, both of us noticed the cinnamon flavoring, which was border line too much; the ingredients list indicates allspice as well.  The only ""fortifications"" to the cookie are calcium (4%) and iron (8%)."

I don't eat protein bars generally, finding the ones that taste decent to be high in carbs or sugar or both-- if I'm going to eat something with that much carb or sugar I might as well ""sin lustfully"" and grab a Hershey bar.<br /><br />That being said, these bars are chewy with a fruity flavor. They do not taste very chocolatey, nor can you really taste, or even find, the almonds. However, they also do not have a strong bran or ""dog food"" taste as I find with many other protein bars.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy these on my own, and I'm not even sure if I will finish the package, but if you have gluten problems and you like protein bars, you may find you like these."

It left a strong floral aftertaste in my mouth.<br /><br />I don't think I'll be buying this again, it is ""okay"", thus 3 stars = It's Okay in Amazon's rating sytem.<br /><br />This is an herbal blend, caffiene free. Per the ingredients it has: lemon balm, rose petals, honeybush, orange peel, lemon myrtle, lemon verbena, licorice root, lavender, valerian root, natural flavors, ginger, orange essence oil and chinese geranium oil.<br /><br />I liked the idea that these herbs promote calmness but I never felt those effects. I'll stick with pure chamomile blossoms to make chamomile tea (with honey) when I need to unwind."

Unfortunately the first time I gave it to her she vomited right away. I then mixed it with brown rice and she was fine for a few days. Then I gave it too her alone again and it gave her diarrhea. Hate to be gross but she can handle only a little at a time of this canned food, don't know why. I was giving her Eagle Pack canned and never had a problem at all so I'm going back to it. I will keep feeding her the Whole Earth Farms dry food because she likes it but now the price has doubled - used to be $8.69, which I thought was a bit cheap anyway, but the doubling for the same size was a bit of a surprise."

I do agree that if you are a person who drinks a lot of soda or have  child who does, switching to his would be the better alternative.<br />BUT - this drink is not healthy by any means, the amount of fruit juice required for it's tastiness results in a HIGH sugar and calorie content for a fruit juice.

My husband loves the GM brand most of the coffees are mild (even when they say medium roast)...I go for a little more on the medium roast like the some of the Tully's and Caribou brands.  It used to be that we were always ordering the same brands, once we liked a certain one.  But I ventured to try the Wolfgang Puck line.  While this flavor is touted as a medium roast, it seems to be more on the bold side with a little bitterness.  It is still not a bad coffee, just not as good as the ""Rodeo Drive"" or ""Breakfast in Bed"" k-cups which has no bitterness.  I must say though, we have now added the latter 2 flavors of Wolfgang to our buying ritual."
238076,Noah D. Goldblatt,3,"I thought that I would leave a few of these in the office to eat as lunches. Well, they are much more complicated to deal with than your standard microwave frozen meal because they involve filling with water, straining, and the potential for the water to bubble/boil over the strainer lid and into your microwave, resulting in a total mess. They taste good, and they are a decent deal if you use Shop and Save, but ultimately they were not filling enough for all of the work they required to make. I thought to myself, why don't I just make pasta instead of ""faking"" it? And I tried to be recycle these containers in vain by refilling them with pasta and that project failed miserably, as I'm sure other people have tried as well. The pasta that comes in these Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers is a special type that cooks quickly, perhaps because the noodles are so much more tiny than regular rotini pasta. So the packaging is a mess, it cannot be reused, it isn't filling, but it tastes good and it is a hot pasta dish in less than five minutes in the office. I would be more eager to try their other varieties but I am a vegetarian."
478352,"Robert P. Roehm ""phoenix_systemsoft""",3,"No, the color in the bag I got looked more like Breakfast Blend, with a combination of light and dark roasted beans. Well, in the bag I got, there was even one GREEN coffee bean in there. It performs poorly, the brew color out of the auto-grind espresso machine I have quits rather too quickly. That prompts an adjustment to use less water, which means I have to do more brew cycles to fill a cup, three instead of two. That kinda kills the savings.<br /><br />This bean works very well for blended drinks, since the lighter flavor doesn't become overpowering when blended with ice, milk and sugar.<br /><br />I ate a few beans and they had this immature taste, not full-bodied coffee, like a burnt pinto bean taste. It seems like they got a supplier that includes a higher percentage of immature beans (not fully ripened when picked) which tens to roast into a lighter color than the rest. Either the picking machine's driver did not adjust to prevent picking the immature beans, or they decidedly had it set to increase yield at the sacrifice of the quality.<br /><br />Only using this one for iced coffee drinks."

Throw one in your child's lunchbox and send him/her off.  Frankly, these cookies are not nearly as delicious as the ones my husband and I make and ours are lower in fat and calories, with fewer additives.  In other words, healthier.<br /><br />But ""healthier"" isn't why most people buy pre-made food products and these cookies taste good enough.  I love oatmeal raisin cookies and I wasn't disappointed by these enough to dislike them.  However, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004L5UD2K"">Grandma's Homestyle Oatmeal Raisin Big Cookie, 2.5 Oz Bag (Pack of 20)</a> are lower in calories and have the same amount of fat, per cookie.  (Of course, it's hard to eat just the one when there are two in the package so you'd have to share.)<br /><br />I know that it's hard to find time to bake from scratch sometimes but the effort to do so, teaching a child how to measure and mix a recipe from scratch, to then enjoy something that the two (or three or four) of you made together, is invaluable.  Make a double batch and freeze the dough before baking and you wouldn't have to do this every week to have enough cookies to last entire month or longer.  You'll build bonding moments, create less waste, teach simple mathematics and cooking skills, and provide a far healthier snack option for your child(ren).<br /><br />And if you truly don't have the time to bake cookies, then buy some fresh fruit.  If nothing else, you'll have fewer additives and most fruit comes in it's own convenient packaging."

Take a glass bottle of Coke, drink half of it, leave it in the fridge for a couple of days (uncapped) and then drink it again.  This will give you an idea as to how these gummies taste.  It's a flat, refrigerator-tainted Coke taste.  It actually brings back memories as a child of drinking old Coke from the bottle.  That's a plus for older folks like myself.  However, I must admit that there are far better gummies out there.  Try these out if you just have to have a cola flavored gummi.  Otherwise, stick to the sweeter tasting gummies."

Well... the first cup brews up kinda foul and with lots of tannin, really bitter (and not the good kind of bitter either). Thus it's an absolute necessity for me to do a first steeping, strain it out and steep again to get a passably drinkable cup. This is not uncommon for some teas, but the cup you get is still pretty foul, truth be told: still real tannic and just not a happy quaff. The leaves are relatively crude and large. This is not one of those tippy-leaved harvests where they grab just the tiny bud; this tea was picked for volume production. For an Oolong it seems to have been barely fermented. I find it just a crude tea. Crude and rude. Figured for the price it'd be a good everyday drinking teas and didn't expect a religious experience in every cup or anything, but it just doesn't even rise to that basic standard. I would have given it only 2 stars, but for the price and the fact that it's organically grown. Your mileage may vary I guess, but that's this tea-head's humble opinion for what it's worth."

Even so, the green rooibos does make a nice base to try adding other, more pungent herbal teas, and the price was so reasonable that experimentation is easy to justify.  I suspect that the processing, not the underlying botanical product, is why this variant seemed bland to me, but everyone has his or her own tastes, of course, and you might conclude otherwise.

There is so LITTLE information about it online, as to what ""manna"" truly was that I just had to try it for myself. Well, first what is it?  It's basically mashed up/ground coconut ""meat"". It has the consistancy of peanut butter that has been slightly melted.  It is also a little gritty too.<br /><br />I was under the impression that it was sweet but it's not.  It is as sweet as unsweetened coconut mash would be.  I was misled by other reviewers that said that it was soooo delicious and they eat it straight from the jar.  I wouldn't do that.  It's just plain boring.  BUT...I think it's the kind of product that would work well in a recipe that called for coconut flavor or texture like cookies, cakes, smoothies, and frostings.  But just to repeat, IT IS NOT SWEET LIKE PEANUT BUTTER!<br /><br />I rate it a 5 out of 10. If you have a sweet tooth like me, this is not the product for you.  If you just need an authentic coconut spread, you've got it.  PLEASE NOTE:  It may be too hard to eat at first.

These damages are happening somewhere between the factory and the Amazon warehouse because the the bubble wrap protection for this could protect a delicate croissant from transit damage.  I gotta start looking for somewhere else to buy if this problem can't be corrected.  I really do like the product itself.  I even finished 1 of the 2 good cans while wiring this.<br /><br />Update 5/16/12 I came back from work and I was so glad to find replacement coconut juice till I opened them up.  Honestly I was expecting around 2-4 slightly crushed cans.  Talk about being wrong.  All 12 were crushed and 6 of them were pretty beat up.  Almost as if they picked out one of the the worse one since this was replacement box.  I am trying to figure out whether I am being unlucky and getting the messed up boxes 2 times in a row or this is how it is and I just got lucky the first time.  Either way very disappointed.  As of this point, if I had to rate the juice by itself I would give 4.5 stars, the quality control 1 star. Honestly who would buy these regularly if all the cans were dented even if it had good flavor? On the plus side Amazon CS gets 5 stars."

It is still really good tea but I will probably go back to Twinings English Breakfast after this box as it is just as good and a bit cheaper, albeit with less attractive packaging.

It stands up to milk and keeps its crunch until its entirely consumed and for me thats important. I could not eat this everyday but I cant think of any product that I could! My Grandson loves it for his snak but I dont give it to him on a regular basis as I think its got too much sugar for a regular diet. All and all I think this is as good as any presweetened cereal I have had but I couldnt eat it more than a couple times a month. This cereal has the same major flaw that all box cereals seem to have, they use a box liner that is not resealable and this limits there shelf life after opening.

This is more of a comment on Amazon for shipping me an expired product thant the product itself."
4962,Steele,3,"Six Hour Power does help to create a more energetic and alert state.  The affect does not last anywhere near six hours.  For me it was a couple of hours.  It is not as strong as Five Hour Power high strength, but it is not positioned as high strength either.  For the money, I would buy this again over the regular Five Hour Power product."
480323,WallyFam,3,"This mix is easy to prepare and makes nice, light pancakes, but I find I have to add 2 to 3 teaspoons of vanilla for flavor or else they don't taste like much. I tried using the recipe on the side of the package for chocolate chip cookies, and they were terrible - the taste and texture weren't good at all. Then I tried the waffle recipe. They were ok, but again, they didn't taste like much. And if you don't eat them all right away, they get soggy; freezing and toasting didn't help much, they just burned in the toaster. So far, the best recipe I have found for waffles/pancakes comes from the book The Best Gluten Free Family Cookbook by Donna Washburn and Heather Butt. You have to buy several flours (sorghum, almond, brown rice, and soy) and two starches to make the mix, but it's totally worth it. As for Pamela's Baking and Pancake mix, I know everyone else raves about it, and for pancakes the texture is surprisingly like regular wheat pancakes, but taste is blah and the other recipes aren't very good. I used up my case of 6, but won't be repurchasing.<br />UPDATE**I had been unhappy with using this as a baking mix until I tried the recipe for muffins on the side of the bag. I made them exactly as directed, using honey and frozen blueberries as the fruit. They are delicious. Tip: if you can't eat them fast enough, they get crumbly (overnight!) so freeze them as soon as they've cooled or store them in food saver containers."

123156,"O. Brown ""Ms. O. Khannah-Brown""",3,"***<br />Stash's Lemon Ginger Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is a basic lemon ginger tea, tasting strongly of ginger, and full of flavorings, and oddly, even contains soy. This is one of the better commercial highly processed, non-organic teas. I much prefer organic teas that are made without artificial flavorings and certainly without soy, but if you are not picky about herb teas, and are looking something very strongly flavored as an introduction to the world of teasans and decaffeinated beverages, this would be fine. If you like your tea more subtle, with true pure tastes, and can discern complex differences between natural and commercial teas, then this definitely is not for you, and I would recommend any Numi tea, Yogi Tea, Traditional Medicinals, or even Stash's organic line of teas (which comes in a wonderful Lemon Ginger Organic Tea!)<br /><br />Stash Lemon Ginger Tea contains ginger root, lemongrass, lemon flavor, safflower, hibiscus, citric acid, and soy.<br /><br />Unfortunately, nothing special.<br />***"

After brewing several pots of it I have to say I'm not that impressed with it.  It's smooth enough, with no bitterness but the overall flavor is weak and bland.  It's not a bad coffee but it's by no means the best coffee I've ever had and once this bag is used up I wouldn't buy any to replace it."

Perhaps if you have an ""outside"" dog this would be fine...but, no, it would attract skunks and raccoons. You have to REALLY LOVE YOUR DOG if you are willing to put up with the smell.

313961,Eric Aderhold,3,"I tried this sauce with some friends of mine when we got together and made burritos. We all seemed to agree that the sauce tastes fine, but it's probably not worth buying. For a ""bold and creamy spicy ranchero sauce,"" I was expecting something a bit bolder and spicier. It was definitely creamy, but the flavor wasn't very memorable. The spice level was comparable to medium salsa, maybe even a bit milder than that. One friend summed it up pretty nicely by saying it didn't taste very ""ranchero-y"" to her.<br /><br />In addition to the rather underwhelming flavor, this sauce comes in an extremely small bottle. It's shaped in a somewhat deceptive manner that maximizes its surface area, but the reality is that the sauce inside will fill a soda can two-thirds of the way to the top. This stuff tastes fine, but there have to be better-tasting sauces out there that are cheaper besides."

I agree with most of the reviews that it really makes a difference in the flavor of the wine.  However, I'm a bit frustrated with how messy it is.  The wine spurts out the two air holes and ends up all over the stand and the table.  I've tried pouring faster and slower in a vain attempt to prevent the mess, but I haven't been successful yet.  The only way I've found to address the problem is by wrapping a paper towel loosely around the cone before putting it in the stand so it soaks up the wine before it has a chance to drip all over the place.  This is the only wine aerator I've ever used, so for all I know this might be a common problem with all of them.  At least the wine tastes better..."

Sure, in comparison to instant oatmeal, loaded withi sugar, it's better. But any whole oatmeal product from the health food store, or even Quaker oatmeal (not the instant) is just as good. Holly's oatmeal contains bits of dried fruit and nuts which is not that big of a deal. Any steel cut oatmeal or even Quaker whole oats can be made with fresh fruit, and a sprinkling of flax, nuts, or anything you desire to make a hearty healthful bowl. Holly's is over-rated. Holly sure has some gig going for herself. I rate it average, not better, than other types of oatmeal except for the instant kind."

I tend to pour more of this product than other low-carb syrups as they still have carbs that will add up fast into the ""significant carb count"" zone.  I pour more since it's sugar free, calorie free, fat free, and carb free, but if it's that free of anything then it must only be made from water plus lots of chemical stuff.  What I really do miss is regular syrup's sticky texture as you eat it with pancakes, French toast, or whatever.  I may not buy the product again, but it was worth a try."

388240,C. Maynard,3,"As I have long, thick somewhat curly hair, I am always looking for a great conditioner that can handle a hard job. This product looked promising according to its claims. I used the conditioner everyday until it ran out (which took close to two weeks for me).<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />I think this has potential for the person with the right hair type. It claims it is for all types of hair, but that is not the case with mine.<br /><br />Though some have complained regarding the bottle design, I rather like it. To get all the conditioner out of a bottle, I usually have to keep it upside down anyway. This bottle is designed to stand ""upside down"", and consequently, I felt that I was able to use the whole bottle of conditioner.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />I do not see any difference in hair health between using this conditoner and the ones I have used before. My hair does not have a marked change. I will grant that I did not use the companion shampoo, but even so, I expected at least a little improvement in the health of my hair.<br /><br />This conditioner is heavily perfumed. I am not usually sensitive to things like perfumes, but every time I used this product, it made my eyes water and itch slightly.<br /><br />It seemed oily to me (though this may be a plus for some people).I prefer creaminess to oiliness. It has an appearance of being creamy, but feels oily.<br /><br />I won't be using this again, mostly due to the heavy perfume/itchy eye issue. Conditioners certainly are not a  ""one size fits all"" type thing; this conditioner may very well be great for the right hair type, but it isn't for my hair."

307325,Kathleen San Martino,3,"This China Oolong tea tastes EXACTLY like what you are served for free in almost every Chinese Restaurant.  That's not a bad thing because the taste of such a tea is decent.  However, I did not expect that it would taste like this since the product description on the site says ""... beautiful and full bodied with a fragrant flavor and fruity, sweet aroma.""  This tea is definitely full-bodied but it is not fruity nor sweet; instead it has a very faint smoky aftertaste similar to Lapsang Souchong tea but definitely not as strong.<br /><br />On the plus side, when steeped the leaves unfurl beautifully.  It is only because the taste was not what I expected that I give it three stars. I only like the tea in Chinese Restaurants; not love it. Although insignificanat with regard to the product; the description on the tin says ""TIKUANYIN China Oolong Tea"" not ""Tie Guan Yin......""  Apparently Amazon got more than the flavor wrong."

380288,D. Schryver,3,"We own the Senseo coffee maker and were using the Senseo coffee pods.  I was so excited to find the Javapodz flavored coffee.  However, they tell you that you only need to use one pod for an 8oz cup, unlike the Senseo coffee where you use 2 pods for an 8 oz cup.  After drinking the Senseo, I found the Javapods to be a bit weaker coffee flavor, especially after I add half and half.<br /><br />My remedy to this was to use one Senseo mild pod and one flavored javapod and make a 12 oz cup, by using the 2 cup button and then directly after without changing pods I used the 1 cup button.  This works wonderfully for me as I get the stronger coffee taste with the wonderful flavor that Javapodz offers.  It makes a super iced coffee as well!<br /><br />The packaging is great.  Each pod is foil wrapped so they stay fresh for a long time."

479731,Jack Richman,3,"I gave this product five stars in my original review, but now it's down to three.  I prefer the look and feel and the clicking confirmation that tells you when to stop pumping of the Concerto over Vacu Vin's original model , but it hasn't proven to be as durable. Less than a year after I got it, the pump seized up and couldn't be used until I sprayed some WD-40 lubricant in it.  It worked fine for over a year until the bottom of the pump mechanism broke off completely.  I've taken the original model out of mothballs."
40274,"L. Connor ""paraselenic""",3,"I just received this package of four-- September 2012. All four canisters had an expiration date of November 2012! My husband and I should be able to drink all of it prior to the expiration date-- but really, a little over one month is not a lot of time to finish four canisters of coffee.<br /><br />Also, packaging-wise the product arrived covered with coffee powder, wrapped in plastic. At first I thought that one of the canisters had opened during shipping, but all of the foils were intact, so I have no idea where all the coffee powder came from.<br /><br />Outside of that, the coffee is good, the shipping was super fast, and the cost is better than the grocery stores. If you know you'll drink it fast (or you're not too militant about expiration dates), it's a good deal."

347589,Rawim,3,"It's peppermint tea, but it is not great peppermint tea.<br /><br />I like many other reviewers admit that it is a peppermint tea and it tastes like peppermint and has a mild menthol-ish kick, but other than that it was just very bland and not at all flavorful.<br /><br />I really like my teas to give me some flavor, and this tea just doesn't deliver in my case.  I have tried increasing my steeping time and all I get is more of the blandish flavor, that strong mint kick I like from my peppermint teas never comes out.<br /><br />Now I realize that this may just be a problem for me and I like unusually strong tea, but I don't think so.  Most teas I get at cafes and what not are strong enough for me, but like I said this tea just doesn't do it for me.  It is also possible that like others I may have gotten a batch a weak leaves?  Who knows?<br /><br />Overall the teas is plenty drinkable and I will probably finish the box, but I don't think I will be buying getting this brand again.  If you have any questions feel free to leave a comment and I will try to answer."

I have let other people tried it, and they all too agreed that ""energize"" was one of the last words they would use to describe the tea.<br />However, due to the tea being very different, it does add something ""different"" for my collection.

However, as far as the ""energy boost"" that is suppose to accompany the use of the product . . . well I am more than a little skeptical.

517149,J. Jones,3,"This Stevia has less of an aftertaste than the original Stevia.  It is very sweet but it does contains other ingredients.  Instead of repeating I recommend you read K. Franklin's review on ingredients.  It is also a little pricey.  Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Stevia, 35-Count Package (Pack of 6) for 32.52.  That is 5.42 for a box of 35.  Even though it is organic I though that was  a little high.  All of that said it does sweeten very well so it just depends on how much you want to pay for organic and how you feel about the addition ingredients."
518011,Brigitte Hoch,3,"Green Thunder is a very odd flavored Mio. Based off of other Mio flavors, you would expect a sweeter flavor maybe more along the lines of Green Apple Jolly Rancher. This flavor falls more towards the bland side with the slight feeling of drinking a syrup-y drink as opposed to a liquid water enhancer.<br /><br />Didn't feel a great spike in energy, but enough to carry along for an hour or two.<br /><br />Mixed feelings on this flavor Mio. Probably will not buy again."
497396,Gregory T. Huffines,3,"What ever happen to TUNA in the can. SOLID use to mean SOLID. WHITE use to mean WHITE. The cans are smaller the price is more expensive. My biggest complaint is the ADDITIVES. Soy proteins or something has been added, you can't just drain the water off anymore. You have to rinse and rinse and when you done you have a miserable mess of NOT SOLID, NOT VERY WHITE tuna. This brand is not as bad as COS or STARKIST. I am going to try a natural Tongol tuna next time. A little more expensive but ......... hopefully better that this."

The cookie needs to either be crunchier or more moist. As is it wants to stick to the roof of your mouth, and is just odd. Making it unappealing.

292177,Raudi,3,"The honey tastes great, but I don't notice any of the ""medicine-y"" smells or tastes that others on here claim to experience. It tastes like regular high-grade honey. I will be switching to another brand since this manufacturer uses their own independent anti-bacterial rating system. Unfortunately, corporations cannot be trusted to monitor themselves, as anyone who has spent money on worthless products can testify.<br /><br />I have not noticed any miraculous health benefits from this honey either. It is just very expensive high-quality honey. I will be checking my local coop for an alternate brand now that I am at least aware of Manuka honey. I plan on trying one that is using the standard UMF rating. Even the MGO rating is not trustworthy, since it is done by an industry trade group, which is funded by the corporations who use its services.<br /><br />Don't just read labels - research labels!<br /><br />I downgraded the star rating due to the high cost and the company using their own non-standard rating system.  The taste is 5 star, just don't expect to be cured of any ailments because you are paying more for this brand compared to another."

I've been using the shiritaki noodles that are Soy/tofu based and I like them a lot more.  These are a bit too strange for me. It's plant cellulose it seems.  The texture is of an acquired taste, a bit gelatinous, a bit like cartilage. They're transparent and could be used in an asian soup quite well.  I'm probably going to do this with the remaining bags I got.  It's a different way to eat soluble fibers, but it makes a strange noodle.  I really love the Tofu ones though, So if you can eat soy I'd got for those instead."

That said, they weren't too bad for a filling snack. I will not be purchasing these, however."

Puffs absorb moisture like no other so exposure from a poor seal on the container meant stale puffs.  Will this prevent me from purchasing again?  No.  Usually my puff orders are problem-free so give them a try.  I'm sure your kid (and you!) will love them!"

From what I am reading grains are not the best nutritional option for dogs and that is what this dog food contains.  I will not select this product again.

One of my coaches aptly described them as both ""essential"" and ""gross"".  Kilowatt for kilowatt, these blasts are more expensive and bulkier and do take more time (if that's a concern) to consume, but they don't leave you second-guessing your lifestyle either as they are ""yummier"" and more palatable.  A big downside is that they require way too much chewing, enough that it really interferes with my breathing trying to eat these while running."

The opening is fairly large so you must be careful pouring it.<br /><br />Taste. It does not taste like bacon. It is not very hot. I can eat it from a spoon without having to drink anything afterwards. It taste like liquid smoke with spices added. It is ok but not something I really like. It is ok on a fried egg sandwich. It is ok used to cook popcorn.<br /><br />I will finish the bottle but I doubt I will reorder it. If I change my mind, which I sometimes do with food, I will update."

Not planning ahead enough to buy another case, I picked up these in hope that ""oven roasted"" + ""honey"" = that same goodness.  NOT TRUE.  These almonds are cloyingly sweet.  They also taste a bit milky, but there are no milk products listed, which just makes the flavor even stranger.  They don't have that crusted on goodness of the tin ones.  However, my 6 year old really likes them and, while I don't have a container to compare, I'm thinking that the lack of crusty goodness *might* make these a somewhat healthier choice for her.  So I give the product 3 stars -  an average of 5 from her and 1 from me."

15300,"K. Peterson ""Never too old to learn""",3,"I have a confession to make:  I had one of these bars and a cup of coffee for breakfast, and it was actually not bad.  But the Amazon stars say ""I love it"" for 5 stars, ""I like it"" for 4 stars and ""It's okay"" for 3 stars.  So, I give it 3 stars.  I personally felt the coconut flavor was stronger than the chocolate flavor and I'm not a big coconut fan, but I am a chocolate fan.  It wasn't terribly sweet and I rather think I would have liked it a little better if it had been sweeter (but not too sweet - I'm kind of picky that way).  I liked the oats and the ""gluten free""-ness of it.  I don't eat gluten, so that makes bread/bagels pretty expensive.  These worked out best for breakfast, although I think I used it as a going to bed snack a couple of times.<br /><br />So, just for fun, I got some nutritional information from 1) Pamela's Oat Chocolate Chip bars 2) some unsalted, dry roasted peanuts and 3) some non-gluten gingersnaps.<br /><br />1) 1, 1.41 oz bar  -had 9g fat, 15 mg cholesterol, 130 mg sodium and 2g of protein.<br />2) 1 oz (40 nuts)  -had 14g fat, 0mg cholesterol, 0mg sodium and 7g protein.<br />3) 5 cookies (30g or 1.06 oz)  -had 6g fat, 0mg cholesterol, 85 mg sodium and 2g protein.<br /><br />I think that each of these snacks might serve at one point or another.  If you are looking for high protein, then neither the cookies or the Pamela's bars would do the trick, confirming that the Pamela's bars would be more of a snack than a meal.  So don't eat one of these with coffee for breakfast.  Ever."

It got to a point where he would even refuse to eat and just wanted to drink this all day long.  We started giving him this drink because he was a picky eater to begin with, and he got much worse in terms of variety of foods he would eat when he knew this drink was in the house.  So we had to wean him off this drink for fear he would never try new foods again.  This is not entirely the fault of the drink of course, but it was just counterproductive for us unfortunately because it's so sweet.  It was absolutely great to have this with us on the go and to be able to give it to him when he skipped a meal because of his pickiness.

When you compare the price of yester year and what I paid in todays market, I think I'll try making my own from an old candy cookbook nextime. It was very overpriced for what it was.

My favorite type of coffee is Colombian bean and I have tried Colombian beans anywhere from my grocery stores bulk coffee bin to expensive Gevalia coffee.  Since this is my preferred coffee type, I am trying to find one that I can consistently enjoy,which fits my meager budget.  I was hoping this would be it but it did not fit the bill. I've tried several Amazon offers and thus far Folgers Gourmet Selection Lively Colombian Whole Bean is by far the best for me but unfortunately I am unable to get it through subscribe and save any longer.

506383,Chafu,3,"I have 3 dogs. A 2yo fox terrier, a 5yo shitzu and a 10yo cocker spaniel, all rescues. I have been purchasing this product from Costco for the past 2-3 years. I feed them one piece in the mornings for break fast. I have not noticed any negative side effects. The two younger dogs love the treats but the older cocker is not so enthusiastic anymore. Maybe she knows something I don't. I have even tried them myself and they are not bad, although it does say ""Nor for human consumption"" on the bag. I have often wondered what it is about them that makes them ""unfit"" for human consumption!<br /><br />I have read a lot of reports here stating that their dogs started to vomit or have bloody stools after consuming them. I have noticed that the treats are quite hard and difficult to chew. Most dogs do not bother to chew anyways, especially something as delicious as a piece of chicken, so could it be that they are swallowing the treats whole and this is what is causing the distress? This is a reasonable hypothesis and should be studied further. It's hard to believe that Costco would sell a knowingly tainted product so for the time being I will proceed with caution."

Also, a tablespoon or two of a  liquere like baileys irish cream, kahlua, rum, or even grand marnier/cointreau added to the ripened bananas/coconut milk/sour cream may also be tasty."

It is much better with milk (like any other latte).<br /><br />Personally I enjoyed the product when made with milk, the only drawback is that your calorie, and fat content rises with the addition of the milk, so it is no longer simply a coffee product.  However, that being said, if you are looking for a decent alternative at home, rather than heading out to the coffee shop to drop $4.50 on a Pumpkin Latte, this product will certainly work for you."
249585,"Marshall Carter ""Ornery Gamer, Fiend Club Member""",3,"I received my sample from Amazon and the first thing that I did was pour it into a glass, over ice. While it's not bad, one thing that I will mention is that it just didn't taste like watermelon or strawberry...the taste is overwhelmingly that of apple juice...plain old apple juice. There are quite a few juices listed in the ingredients, including some not-so-common ones (acerola for instance), but I'm guessing the quantities were trace-like at best. Nope, what you get here is carbonated apple juice with maybe a hint of the berries' tartness...any watermelon flavor is lost somewhere in the mix, which isn't particularly surprising. Frankly, the effervescence is more pleasing than the actual taste.<br /><br />It's not really bad, I'd drink it again, but there are healthier things out there that you could be drinking. It might not have sugar added, but the sugar that's naturally in the juice is more than enough. All-natural doesn't always translate to good-for-you, which is something that seems to go over the head of some individuals. It might be better than soft drinks, but there really isn't much nutrition to be found here. All-in-all, it might be a good thing to toss in to mix things up a bit, but it's not something I'm going to think is going to turn my life around, or be particularly noteworthy when it comes to pleasing to my palette."
289714,happymama,3,I have tried several brands of coconut water out there and I like the fact that this brand is lower in sugar than some of the others yet this brand does have a stronger flavor and it is made from concentrate.
515097,"A. Casey ""Desert Shrink""",3,"I agree with previous reviews.  The shakes are tasty -- I mix them with sugar-free chocolate milk -- and they do help stabilize blood sugar.  They are a good source of protein, too.  The company's customer service, however, is pitiful.  I have tried to order directly from their website.  Orders take forever to ship; mistakes are common; and attempts to correct those mistakes are met with an attitude bordering on clueless (or careless, as in Do Not Care).  Not a pretty picture.  If it weren't for the fact that they have targeted a niche market, I would guess they would drive themselves out of business pretty fast."
418589,Trippster,3,"I bought this gum along with the Grape and Strawberry flavors from bubblicious. Of the three, this is my least favorite. Don't get me wrong, I love watermelon and watermelon flavor but this gums flavor just doesn't last very long compared to the other two, and it seems a little off for watermelon flavor."
259380,William Renfroe,3,"I really like the cherries, but I don't like the packaging.  When I bought from this same supplier in the past (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5DYEO"">Traverse Bay Dried Fruit, Dried Cherries, 2-Pound Bags (Pack of 2)</a>) the bags were resealable, which is nice for those of us who aren't cooking enough at one time to feed a small army.<br />These cherries taste great right now, but since the packaging is not resealable I had to transfer them to something that CAN be sealed so they will stay fresh.  After all, most of us don't go through cherries by the pound in a short period of time.<br />When I checked today the cherries in two resealable 2 pound bags were selling for slightly less than this box that is nominally the same size."
255561,CAH,3,"I have been feeding my 11 year old terrier Purina One her entire life.  She has been eating the Vibrant Maturity formula for the past 4 years & loved it.  When I opened this most recent bag, I noticed that there were rubbery morsels mixed in with the kibbles.  The shape & size of the kibbles changed slightly also.  After 5 days of attempting to get my dog to eat this I finally gave up.  I called Purina, and the representative I spoke to recommended Pro Plan as an alternative.  My dog loves the Pro Plan, which looks just like the way the Purina One Vibrant Maturity use to look.  Purina is an excellent company; the rep. sent me a coupon for a free bag of Pro Plan and another $5.00 coupon.  She told me that the formula was changed about 1 year ago.  I donated this bag to the local shelter."

324098,"Mattie ""Mattie""",3,"I purchased these for hubby for the times when he doesn't find a few minutes to be able to eat lunch or breakfast. I don't drink coffee but tried a bite of one of these and didn't find any strong coffee flavor. We both agree that the cookies are very dry tasting. They will work for what he needed them for but they aren't something he would enjoy just to have a snack, just too dry."
445449,Grits,3,"I was thrilled to learn that General Mills began offering gluten-free rice chex and corn Chex a while back.  And being a chocolate lover, when they also made Chocolate Chex gluten-free, I could not wait to try it.  It was quite a disappointment.  To me at least, the chocolate flavor seemed to be just that - flavor - not what actually tastes like real chocolate.  It's not awful, and I won't have a problem eating the whole case of 6 boxes, but it'll be just a bit at a time until all the boxes are gone.  I don't anticipate purchasing more of it.  I truly wanted this to be a 5-star product - it just isn't."
187868,Des123,3,"I started out exclusively breastfeeding my newborn until I ran into supply issues after he was a few weeks old. We had to supplement and had a sample of this and wanted to ease him into formula, so we figured Gentlease was a great choice. He didn't have gas issues on breastmilk but had been a little fussy and we weren't sure if it was due to gas, so we decided to start with it in addition to breastmilk.<br /><br />When we started this, off the bat we noticed our little guy spit up like crazy-like half his bottle at times. We paced his feedings, burped him in between bottles and did leg exercises in case it was air/gas. In addition, his feedings went from every 2-3 hours to 1.5-2 and he went up from 3oz to 4oz of formula in a matter of days. The formula is definitely thinner than others and when researching it, we found other parents pointed out the same cons we ran into. We wanted to give it a chance and thought it might just be that he had to get use to formula. After 2 weeks, not much changed so we decided it was time to switch. He had bouts of gas pain too which we found odd.<br /><br />Yesterday we not only switched him to the Costco version, we bought Dr. Brown bottles (originally using Avent-which worked just fine but we wanted to try anything to get him from spitting up as much as he had been and to reduce any gas). We're happy to report he stopped his intense liquidy spit ups and now just does it maybe once during a feeding. He has been a little gassy but hasn't cried or had little fits he had when we were on Gentlease. We also got the gas drops just in case. He also stays full closer to every 3 hour feedings and slept through the night for almost 7 hours-his first time doing that! I'll update this if things change, but so far we couldn't be more relieved!"
275032,"MagnoliaSouth ""As soon go kindle fire with sn...",3,"The product itself is really good and I'll review that in a moment. First, I want to say that the price not worth its expense. I ended up deducting two stars for the serious price gouge. If the price were better, they would have gotten 5 stars and pay attention carefully. I have posted the prices I see today, so if they change then take that into consideration.<br /><br />PRICE COMPARISON<br /><br />I bought the Walmart brand three days ago and using my receipt, I'm going to compare it with today's Amazon price:<br /><br />Walmart Great Value Brand (16 oz.) container<br />$1.98 each/$23.76 for 12<br /><br />Amazon's Coffee Mate (16 oz) container at the 15% off subscription price<br />$2.85 each/$34.25 for 12<br /><br />Again, this is even using the subscription price and not Amazon's actual retail price. That is a significant price difference.<br /><br />No thanks!<br /><br />COFFEE MATE REVIEW<br /><br />Is Coffee Mate better than a store brand? A little bit, but not by that much. There is a slight difference in quality but it is so slight that it just is not worth the price difference. It is definitely tasty though. On that subject, the fat free type is much less creamy than the regular. That alone is a serious change. I easily got used to it though. My heart thanks me for it. ;)<br /><br />POWDERED VS REFRIGERATED<br /><br />There are benefits for using powdered over refrigerated creamer. The primary reasons I choose powdered are:<br /><br />* Keeping coffee hot. Refrigerator cools it too much for my liking.<br />* Better shelf life. I don't use much, so in my home the refrigerated kind gets wasted and goes bad, before I can use it.<br />* Price. Powdered is always cheaper than refrigerated.<br /><br />There is really only one con to buying powdered over refrigerated and that being there is no nutritional value to it. I don't care about that part though because I am a heavy milk drinker. I still get my daily dairy nutrition.<br /><br />Overall, I would not recommend this due to its price. If you don't mind the pricing, then the product is comparable to all others so there is no reason not to buy it."
313785,Romance Reviewer,3,"First, I echo other reviewers' comments that this really should be very cold before you even consider drinking it. I made the mistake of taking a luke warm sip, and it tasted like putty.<br /><br />Assuming that it's chilled, this actually has a pretty good chocolate flavor. The calorie content is high, so it's really best for larger men, or those who workout. To be fair, Gatorade has printed very clearly on the bottle that it's intended for athletes, so I'm confused by some of the reviewers to criticize the high calorie content. It's not meant to be a simple meal replacement for the average person, and shouldn't be reviewed as such.<br /><br />That being said, this is the sort of product that I would grab in a pinch, but wouldn't go out of my way to buy."
68055,pumpkinspice,3,"This was my first time eating dates, so I've nothing to compare them to, but what I can say about them is that they're mildly sweet, but a little drier than I expected. They work fine as an ingredient, but I don't think they're good to snack on or eat plain."
232830,Lila Klu,3,"I thought it was OK... overall.  The chocolate coating does at least taste--and melt--like chocolate, which for a protein/meal bar is not exactly something you can expect.  The bar did last longer going down though: not only because it's bigger, but because it's so tough to chew! (A little too tough for me; the center could use a little moisture.)  Maybe peanut just isn't my favorite in any bar--which seems to be the case; although this bar doesn't taste especially peanutty.  Lastly, 10 calories short of 300 is really over the limit for me in the bar category."
59083,Ryan,3,"we bought this based on the high recommendations on reviews.  i think it is only fair to add that my wife and i give it a ""meh"".<br /><br />we were super excited when we first brewed it as it smells wonderful, however, drinking it didn't measure up to expectations.<br /><br />we prefer the hazelnut offered by same manufacturer."
162048,Cousin Joe,3,"So after reading all the reviews here we were excited to try another Nylabone for our Rottie who, putting it mildly, is a super aggressive chewer. He either has had or currently owns all of the largest Nylabones the company has to offer and we were happy to see the size of this one compared to his other large bones. Unfortunately the honeymoon didn't last long because within the first few hours of ownership he chewed off 1/4 of the green middle part. He starts with the nubs and gradually works his way onto larger chunks. He is always supervised with new toys and lucky for us he isn't a swallower of large chunks, although I'm sure we will find our fair share of green nubs in the yard tomorrow morning after his usual morning business - a nice little St. Paddy's day treat for us all! Oh yeah, it does smell pretty good overall as the mint hides some of the usual slobber stench so that's a plus as well."
543831,"Andrea Griffin ""Avid Reader""",3,"My 18 year old daughter is an avid water drinker...and has been since she was six (having officially moved off milk). She's tried almost every brand/flavor of water additive on the market - from Crystal Light to Mio - she's tried just about all of them.  So when I'd received this product...I thought she'd be the perfect taste tester.<br /><br />She used Vitamin Squeeze (fruit punch) with both bottled distilled water as well as bottled spring water...and enjoyed it with both.  She described the taste as ""a pleasant fruity flavor"" but warned to stick with a single squeeze serving - otherwise the flavor became quickly overpowering.  She added that she liked the fact that essential vitamins were added to the water.  All in all - she enjoyed this product BUT also felt that, despite the decent flavor, it really doesn't stand out from the crowd of water additives."
31855,K. King,3,"I was hesitant to order this because of the recurring complaint of damaged cans, but then noticed that those reviews seem less recent, and it looks like the shipping issue was resolved (I selected the ""Amazon Frustration-Free"" packaging).  The cans arrived in perfect condition, before their use-by date, etc.<br /><br />However, the texture of the pumpkin seems a bit off. We add the pumpkin to our dogs' food. Before buying this product, we typically used the large can of Libby's brand. The texture of this product is much firmer than the canned Libby's we were using, and it even looked like there was some congealed fat in the ""Farmer's Market"" can, which seems odd for pumpkin. Another difference is that it doesn't seem to be firming up our dogs' poop like the Libby's pumpkin did (sorry if TMI!). We will probably stick with Libby's once we finish the cans from this order."
89720,Dienne,3,"As any human on a diet (or simply trying to eat healthy) can tell you, good tasting and good for you are not necessarily the same thing.  Personally, if I could get away with it, I might eat nothing but ice cream with chocolate syrup.  Unfortunately, ice cream does a number on my stomach, and you don't want to be around me a few hours afterward.  Which is not to say I don't occasionally indulge.<br /><br />This dog food is sort of like that for dogs.  My dog, a thirteen-year-old German Shepherd mix who has been spoiled with canned food most of his life and usually won't touch dry food, scarfed this up in seconds flat.  I'm pretty sure if I'd have let him at it, he would have eaten the entire bag in one sitting (I understand, Callahan, I've been there).  I was pretty excited and all set to rate this a five star dog food.<br /><br />But then, a few hours later, lordy, the smell was enough to knock me out of bed!  Callahan was eager to go outside where, after relieving himself, he spent the rest of the night eating grass, which is what he does when his tummy isn't happy.  But apparently, like me with ice cream, the after effects apparently weren't bad enough to make him stop eating it.  When I offered him some more a week later, he was happy to indulge (with similar results).<br /><br />Other reviewers have compared this to candy for dogs, which is pretty much how I'm treating it.  It may not be good for him, but he loves it and once a week or so isn't going to hurt him.  Yes, the ingredients are all bad for dogs, but then, have you looked at the ingredients in most ice cream brands lately?  If you're concerned about only giving your dog healthy food, I'd pass on this.  But my dog is old and probably won't be around that much longer.  If this food makes him happy (and it does), then I don't see a reason why he can't die happy."
512641,kari,3,The price was right; a bulk order is convenient rather than purchasing small portions. Accomodations to flavor must be made. It is not like any other vanilla I have used. It did not have an essence that I am accustomed to. Has an odd 'after taste' and baking results are different. This may well be due to my limited culinary experience. I would like to offer an A+ to the vendor as I let them know and they very graciously and promptly made ammendments for this persnickety buyer.
144108,Mya,3,"I was hoping this would be a great chew for my dog's teeth, along the line of a bullystick. She's not much of a chewer, but I hoped the flavor would entice her to spend some time gnawing on this. But this isn't really designed for that. It's very crispy and breaks down quickly. While she loved the flavor of this--Tripe--she devoured the whole thing in less than a minute, negating the use of this as an aid in caring for her teeth. For my purposes, I don't think I'd buy it again. But if you're just looking for a tasty treat for your dog, this may be for you."
372093,Afina,3,"As far as quality goes, these are wonderful and very nice but if you are looking for thin laces to help with cookie/cake/pop decorating, might want to look elsewhere. I would use these for a rope around a yard on a cake, not whiskers on a cake pop. Thicker than you would imagine."
280947,cpmaynard,3,"girlfriend hated them but i didnt mind them too much, a little more bitter than i imagined, with a earthy taste but worth the benefits i guess. tried to put them in the fridge, that made them too hard, left them in the car one day and they tasted a little better warm, kinda gooey. def a conversation peice when toting them around with you it seems eveyone asks about them. a couple of them tasted moldy, but very minor, iguess that comes with them being sun dried with no preseratives"

97407,"T. Coleman ""Rio Grande Tom""",3,"I've giving it three stars based on a guess and on the taste of the non-chocolate flavor. I sort of like the regular, non-chocolate malt, so I'll put the chocolate variety in the middle.  Though I might have given it five stars, had Amazon sent it to me.<br /><br />How about an explanation?<br /><br />OK, I ordered Ovaltine Chocolate Malt Drink Mix, like it says here.  I received malt, no chocolate.  Told Amazon.  They were very nice and immediately shipped another order... of plain malt again.  Since, I've tried to get a response from them.  No real answer, my emails are ignored (very unlike Amazon).<br /><br />I mean, if  they're having some sort of problem finding the right Ovaltine, at least respond and don't leave a very good customer hanging.  Just makes sense to me.  I appreciate courtesy, don't you?<br /><br />Now, at first, I was willing to forgive and forget; but stonewalling ain't nice.  Nope, not a proper way to treat customers.  I really must again add that this is not like Amazon; but somebody has really dropped this ball.  I even have gone to the trouble of paining them pictures,twice, giving links to the different Ovaltines.  No appreciation for my efforts; just silence.<br /><br />I mean, is it possible they expect me to accept what I didn't order but paid for?  Do they think sending another wrong item makes it OK?  Well, you see,their ""expecting"" that is what I don't like.  Changed my own generosity.  Come on, who likes to be stonewalled?  It's arrogant.<br /><br />So, if Amazon will just send the chocolate Ovaltine, as shown here, I'll re-edit this and tell you what I really think of the chocolate version.<br /><br />ADDENDUM<br /><br />Well, I still haven't tasted the chocolate; but I thank Amazon for refunding my money.  They say they found something wrong with the product.  Maybe it just wasn't there?"
429048,SunnyBeachLife,3,"I should have bought Goji berries by themselves because I like them.  This mix wasn't palatable for me.  It certainly may be for you.  Very healthy but those golden berries literally made me gag with their strange, planty-sweet taste and weird texture and it ruined the whole bag.  I even tried it on salads and in foods but couldn't eat it.  The mulberies didn't agree with me either.  Too expensive for the taste to be off like that.  I'll just go for the plain Gojis next time."

Shame on you, Amazon, for not changing the description when others have posted this same concern in their reviews. I should have listened to the reviewers but thought by now Amazon would have fixed the error!  Instead of Mediterranean Tuna we are buying Tuna that hasn't seen the Mediterranean Sea but instead the South Sea.  I am very curious as to how this changes the toxic, heavy metal counts as Italy has a high ethic standard to packaging food with the Made In Italy statement vs other countries...Thailand for one.<br /><br />As for the taste, it's tuna packed in olive oil which, to me, tastes better than water-packed.  I've never bought it pre-Thailand (actually Made in Italy)so can't compare if it's changed.  It's a good tuna, my cats love it, and I will use it...but will be very concerned how many contaminants I'm eating along with the seafood :(<br /><br />Just be aware of what you are buying BEFORE you order this if it makes a difference to you!<br /><br />ETA:  THANK YOU, AMAZON, FOR ADDING 'MADE IN THAILAND' in the description!<br /><br />After quite a few cans of this tuna, it is still good tasting and a perfect individual size."
63220,"Jeffrey E ""jeffinaustintx""",3,"The good thing about a cheese like cheddar is that is packs a lot of flavor in it.  This translates well to secondary products like crackers.  Mozzarella - not so much.  Mozzarella is so mild that when you try to put it into a product like a cracker, it will inherently have a too mild flavor, so you'll need to enhance this somehow.  The easy thing would be to add salt, but Kellogg decided to use spices.  This makes the product taste closer to ""Ranch dressing"" more than cheese.<br /><br />The product is also marked as ""Creamy & Mild"".  True enough but just what the heck do they use to make a cracker taste ""creamy""???  It is kind of weird to me.<br /><br />I'll stick with the original."
218069,mean incognito monkey,3,"I love Cameron's French roast, I love the quality of it, the high roast on the bean, love the overall flavor.  So I thought we'd enjoy their lighter roast too when we want a less robust coffee.  This didn't do it though. It's an adequate coffee, meaning not terrible and it is fresh, but it's got a back sort of oily/clanky flavor reminding me of supermarket brands, which isn't terrible but not good either.<br /><br />I always freeze my coffee, taking out what I need for about a week and storing those beans in a container in the frig, so the coffee is always fresh and we use a Cuisinart grind and brew, which makes great coffee.<br /><br />I would use it again if I had to, but I wouldn't recommend it as Cameron's best nor would I go out of my way to buy it."
139231,B. Barden,3,"If you have never tried coconut manna, you may be a little shocked. Texture is a bit like 'dry' peanut butter or almond butter. I thought that since coconut oil is very 'wet' (even though it is solid at room temperature) that it would give this that quality but I didn't find that to be the case. I purchased a two pack (very good deal, in my humble opinion) and it will last for quite a while.<br /><br />The flavor of this is good. It smells like coconut but the taste is not sweet per se and reminds me more of a nut butter (but without the 'sweetness'). It is unsweetened and consists only of organic whole coconut. You can find some recipes at nutiva.com but I didn't find them very helpful (unless you also are accustomed to purchasing hempseed and/or other ingredients). I have tried this with oatmeal a few times. Normally I eat oatmeal with only butter. On the jar it has a recipe for ""Manna Oatmeal"" but again, it includes hempseed -which I excluded. It made the oatmeal very very dry but it did add a pleasant taste to it.<br /><br />As with coconut oil, this is solid at room temperature. The container says it liquefies at above 73*. In our house it is generally in the 60s. I actually put it in the microwave for 30 second intervals until it was soft enough to stir together. Otherwise I use a spoon and scrape out what I need. When using it in my oatmeal, which is already hot, that works fine as it melts into the oatmeal but I wonder how well it'd work to spread it on toast when I wanted.<br /><br />I am interested to see how it can be used for other things (it says it can replace butter, cream cheese and cream in recipes). I wasn't sure to give this a 3 or 4 star rating because I've never tried it before by any other brand. I like it enough to possibly buy more in the future."
400892,Tiger,3,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 7:08 Mins<br /><br /></span>It really depends on many factors, so experiences will vary.  I think you will likely find varying degrees of success, not complete eradication.  If you have multiple pests, then you will probably deter some of them, in which you find 2-4 star reviews.  Or if you have one pest, whether or not it works on that one determines 1 or 5 star reviews.  I am happy with the products attempt to deter and isn't a gimmick, but the value will depend on your level of success.  Based on many reviews, clearly success varies.  At least this 5-lb shaker seems to last longer than the smaller cans at the local store.<br /><br />So it is really just a big can of pepper, mostly black pepper and cayenne pepper which are two of the 3 active ingredients.  Peppers smell and taste unpleasant to animals.  Whether this blend and processing are the perfect solution and cost effectiveness versus wholesale black and cayenne pepper depends.  It isn't a fence or barrier, just a deterrent to make it more unpleasant than the next alternative location for the animal which will hopefully move on and do its business elsewhere.  But you will be fighting against (1) habits that might take time to break, (2) areas previously marked by animals or other droppings that are more attractive that offset or overpower this, (3) if yours is still the least unpleasant alternative to limited or worse options, (4) the animal's sensitivity to taste and smell of this deterrent, and (5) how fast it gets washed away and perform at reduced levels.  You could have an old dog that has lost much of its sense of smell and has been using your lawn for ages and has marked the area that probably would be less deterred to change.  Or a cat's habit and previous droppings might overpower this product.<br /><br />This is similar to you going to the beach.  Suppose rocks litter one side of the beach along with a dead fish that washed up on shore and smells a little.  It doesn't stop you from walking through there, it is just unpleasant to setup your towel or walk around over there.  But you might walk through it to find better sands elsewhere.  But you would prefer to walk to the side of the beach that is sandy with a fresh air breeze.  Your yard is the beach to the pests.  You are just trying to make it less desirable."

71523,Robin,3,I bought these after trying my coworker's stash. Mine came quickly but I was disappointed with the difference in quality as compared to my coworker's bag (which she bought from a brick & mortar). The chocolate was harder in my bag and the berries were way too small. Sometimes it felt like I was eating berry-flavored chocolate instead of chocolate covered berries. Not sure if I'll purchase again in the future since it's pricey.
177557,Book Worm,3,"This was an okay cookie.  It's more of a cross between a dry brownie and a soft cookie.  It was chewy, but I wouldn't say it was all that gooey as the name implies.  The double dose of chocolate and nuts are great for chocolate lovers, though.  And I did like the re-sealable package, so the cookies will stay soft longer.  If you like double chocolate cookies with nuts and/or Chips Ahoy cookies, you may like this one.  I liked them, but I did not love them."

246997,MR,3,"Local grocery and convenience stores sell Reese's peanut butter cups for about $1 for a two-pack. So when I saw that they were on sale here on Amazon for less than $1 each for packs of four, I was thrilled. However, the feeling has since eroded after noticing a couple of issues:<br /><br />1) Another reviewer said that the candy comes nearly stale, and I have to agree partially. The packages are almost expired (in just 6 months), but from what I can tell, the taste still seems OK (for me).<br /><br />2) There is weird condensation on each peanut butter cup. This is strange because where I am now there is super low humidity (just 26% with fire watches). So I am not sure where the condensation came from but the box does say to store in a cool DRY place.<br /><br />Other than those two things, I cautiously tried a taste test and they do seem OK. If you are looking for ultra-fresh, you may be better off shopping somewhere local. But if you'll give these away or your family goes through them fast, then maybe it's worth the low price. I don't think I will buy again, though."
44717,olivia,3,"I was waiting with higer expectations to this product, just before yesterday when it was delievered.<br />I expected the taste would be sweet and rich-cocoa since they are saying it is cocoa roasting almonds, but it's just slightly rosted with cocoa. once I taste it, I was pretty disappointed.<br />it's just not only real almonds's taste, but also not strong cocoa's taste. also, they are very dry. that's why it's easy to be cracked.<br />anyway, if I knew it's just weak taste of cocoa, i would just bought the raw ones for rich and fresh taste."
77721,Gagewyn,3,"This is marketed as healthy all natural all juice.  From the full nutrition label, Switch lives up to that claim.  The ingredients are juice caoncentrates and added vitamin C.  No added sugar.  Just like juice, you get fruit sugar and fruit nutrients, but none of the fiber.  That's to be expected from a juice, although it seems some other reviewers were alarmed to discover that fruit is sweet due to sugar rather than naturally growing aspartame or sucrose.  Healthwise, this seems fine to me.<br /><br />As to taste:  I was expecting ""Black Cherry"" in a dark red can to be strong.  This was mellow.  I could taste the cherry juice, but I think apple was the dominant flavor.  This tasted remarkably like a children's juice box or a capri sun baggie, probably because it's a mix of juices in which apple is prominent.  It tasted like real juice - not fake.<br /><br />The carbonation was light, and added a bit of texture.  At home, purchasing fruit juice in a bottle and seltzer water in a bottle and mixing them in a glass provides more options and a taste of carbonated fruit juice.  I used to do lots of carbonated fruit juice mixes, and think I prefer plain apple juice and seltzer water to this, mostly because the Switch flavor didn't strike me.  Which juice sits best with you will be a matter of taste, and if you like carbonated fruit juice, then this could be a way to make it portable for bag lunches, road trips, and such.<br /><br />Overall, if you drink a lot of sodas and like fruit juice, this is worth a try, perhaps in the form of one can on a road trip.  It's healthier than soda, because it has real sugar (from fruit, not added) instead of high fructose corn syrup, but not as healthy as a piece of fruit.<br /><br />Oh, yes, here is the nutritional information:<br />8.3 oz.,  130 calories, 0g fat, 15mg sodium, 35g total carb, 33g sugar, 0g protein, 100% of vitamin C.<br />Ingredients:  100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, acerola and cherry juice concentrates), natural flavors, ascorbic acis (Vitamin C)"

550865,Diane Antonietta,3,On the package it only says English walnut halves so not sure if they are raw or not.

117947,Michelle Barrett,3,"This stuff tastes like butt... with a hint of peanuts. LOL.<br /><br />Honestly, my hopes for it weren't very high, what with all the reviews and such, but I wanted to try it for myself anyway. I like diet sodas and can tolerate fat-free versions, so I thought that might be the case with this. Haha, nope. It really just tastes terrible. The consistency reminds me of yogurt or pie filling, though don't let that give off the wrong impression that it tastes good, lol.<br /><br />BUT. It mixes well. If I measure 25% real peanut butter and 75% of this (like two teaspoons peanut butter and one tablespoon plus two teaspoons Walden Farms), it actually does taste okay, and that's about 45 calories a serving versus nearly 200. So, it is at least somewhat redeeming of itself in that sense.<br /><br />I recently ordered the PB2 powder because I heard it mixed well with that too. I will update this once I try it myself."

If you must have a sweeter cereal, you can use the 365 Vanilla Almond Milk.<br /><br />Regarding value from the sellers on Amazon.com, I'm concerned by the e-mail Amazon sent me on 1/13/12 advertising a 6 pack of this cereal on ""sale"" for $42.79 ($7.13/box) from Bangalla Organic.  In June of 2011, I purchased a 6 pack from Amazon with Subscribe & Save for $17.91.  Really!  A single box sells for roughly $3.50 at Publix and Target.<br /><br />On a positive value note, Amazon has the Blueberry cereal right now for $15.84 / 6 pack with Subscribe & Save.  That's a great price.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this is a good cereal.  Just don't assume the advertised price on Amazon is good.  Do your homework."

48110,Coco juice lover,3,"I love drinking coconut juice even when I was still living in the Philippines where it was sold by a street vendor and opened right in front of you where he sticks a straw for you to drink right away the goodness and freshness of it. Irreplaceable of course by the juice we buy that's been packed already. But to compare I bought 3 brands,  the Vita coco, One , and Zico. The first 2 have a distinct taste but both tastes good the only thing vita coco was 100 percent coco juice while one coco juice was gently pasteurized. The packaging was great you don't need a straw to drink right away. I bought the bottled zico and after my first drink the taste of plastic container was very evident. That was the downfall for me but just tasting it and taking away the plastic taste on my mind it was good but the taste of plastic ruined it. Maybe next time I'll try the tetra packed zico to see if I'll like it better."

Fortunately there does not look to be any punctures or spoilage of the actual coconut water itself. Am sipping my first one as I write this and the taste is a but stronger and not as sweet as other coco water brands I have tried, but overall a decent taste. The manufacturer/distributor must offer the swell pricing on a case because they are pretty much only shipping the cans with external damage."

I can't tell if it's because it was crushed or not. Spending $2 on a single fruit bar is salty...receiving it in sub-par condition is ridiculous."

457396,AKSarah,3,"Blue Buffalo Wilderness Salmon might be a food some dogs do well on.  Mine did not.  It caused itching and loose stool, even after a very gradual switch.  I emailed BB customer service to see if they use wild/Pacific salmon or farmed/Atlantic (which is loaded with antibiotics and dyes--both of which could cause a reaction in animals with sensitivities) and they could not give me an answer.  I'm a fish snob from Alaska but aside from the wild vs. farmed prejudices, I was very concerned that they had no idea the source of their ingredients.<br /><br />This food gets a plus for the fact that it's grain-free.  I appreciate the direction this company is moving.  However, it is NOT a premium dog food in my mind.  Be cautious of any pet food company that doesn't know where their ingredients come from!"
532659,sc,3,"i wasn't satisfied with this mix. What really bothered me is when I opened the bag and slowly emptied the flour into a bowl, it just let out a cloud of flour dust into the air while settling into the bowl. It was more airborne dust than I ever had to deal with from any flour! Also, this is a mix and though it says buckwheat, the mix contains less than 50% buckwheat flour, which to me is overpriced. it's more economical and healthy to buy a denser flour, and add your own baking powder and baking soda to it. The taste is okay but I added my own mashed bananas and pumpkin puree to the batter, for more nutrition and flavor."

239230,C. Rexford,3,"The 60s decade box I ordered arrived in tact, and all the candy inside the box was in fine shape, (nothing was smashed or cracked), each item was full sized and fine.<br />I only gave 3 stars for the selection. Allthough the pieces were indeed items enjoyed in the 60s, I felt the inclusion of candy that is still sold commonly today somewhat took away from the nostalgia, ( an O Henry Bar as one example). The variety of candies may differ for others as stated in the item description, so my minor dissapointment in the selction I recieved will not be everyone's experience. I also recieved a duplicate of one of the candies. For the price I felt it should overall have been a better variety of 60s candies.<br />On a final note, and it bears repeating, the candies were all in fine shape so the quality of each item in the box was not compromised. I only feel the nostalgic value of the items would be at say 60% for what I recieved. I feel it is worth perhaps half the price I paid. (not including s&h)."

I like feeding my kids whole wheat pancakes, but honestly I think Aunt Jemimima makes a better whole wheat pancake mix product.<br /><br />As for the other recipes I've tried using Insta-bake, I've been disappointed every time.  The biscuits are flat, hard, dry little pucks.  No one wanted them.  I've tried a couple of times thinking maybe I just did something wrong.  Nope; they're gross.<br /><br />The cookies I made were also awful.  Yeah, maybe healthier than a tollhouse cookie but since I ended up tossing them out because, healthy or not, they STILL weren't worth the calories and at ANY rate, just tasted bad.  For a good cookie made with whole wheat flour I make these cookies [...]<br /><br />Anyway, for pancakes, fine, but there are other options out there.

71800,Lisa Kearns,3,"I've got fine, curly hair so I have to be careful not to use conditioner too often or it will be limp and the curls won't be bouncy.  I sometimes use shampoos with the conditioners already in them, because separate conditioners are too much.  I often use volumizing shampoo because it tends to strip oils out of my hair and keep it from  being weighed down.<br /><br />I liked this Clear Scalp & Hair volumizing root nourishing shampoo.  It lathers nicely and smells good, and rinses easily.  The bottle is easy to hold on to, and the price for 12 ounces in the bottle is good.  Like some of the other reviewers reported, my bottle arrived in a plastic bag.  The bottle had popped open in shipping and some of the shampoo had leaked out in the bag.<br /><br />This shampoo left my hair soft, shiny and obviously moisturized, but it did weigh my hair down and I had to wash it again the next day. I didn't notice any volumizing with this shampoo - in fact it had the opposite effect for me.<br /><br />I gave the bottle to my daughter to try, since she has dry hair and uses tons of conditioner with every shampoo.  She really liked the scalp nourishing aspect of this product, although she didn't notice any volumizing effects either."

384126,"barbfair ""Barbara""",3,"This is a good product and meets all of the promises expressed by the manufacturer.  I thought initially that it had the same sweetness as sugar, but for some reason I found myself using more of it than I would have used refined sugar under the same circumstances.  I don't know if it's because of the very fine granules (much finer than table sugar), or if it just wasn't really quite as sweet as table sugar; it's hard to say.  I doubt I will purchase this product again unless it comes down in price.  The price seems reasonable until you factor in shipping charges and, again, the fact that it goes so quickly. I purchased a 1 lb. bag and it only lasted for about 10 days. The same amount in table sugar would have lasted a month or longer! I got it to bake with and to use in my coffee but it went so fast I never got the a chance to bake with it!  I have used Suzanne Somers' ""Somer Sweet"", made from a Chinese fruit, so it's a safe artificial sweetener and it's 5 times sweeter than sugar.  I found it to be much more cost-effective than the whey low because the price is comparable but it lasts a very long time.  I went back to that for my coffee.  I have not baked with that product yet, although the manufacturer says that it works beautifully in baking.  Hope this helps."

177731,Goldwing,3,"This is better than diet but falls short of brand name cola taste.  I feel the cola flavor is a little ""spicy"" and not fruity enough. I tried a few mixin's and now I think it is great.  If it came as good as I can mix it, I would give it five stars.  If you decide to try this product, get some True Lemon or Lime, True Orange, stevia packets (with a high level, 90% or better, of steviosides for cleaner,sweeter flavor, and a bottle of cherry snow cone syrup if you like cherry cola.  I use a half packet of lemon and Orange, 1 packet of stevia, and a short squirt of cherry per liter bottle. Now the flavor falls between generic and brand name.  Cheaper than using cans, but not cheaper than using two liter bottles.  The calorie count is about a third of normal cola.  You have to be comfortable with Splenda and Ace-K as Soda Stream uses those to offset some of the sugar (not corn Syrup a plus).  Thankfully no Nutrasweet/aspartame as I get terrible headaches from that."
431559,Terilyn,3,This sprounter jar was a little expensive for just being a plastic lid and glass canning jar.  The lid will be great for not rusting but the holes are small enough that the water was slow to go in for rinsing.  I don't want to have to take off the lid to rinse twice daily. I keep 5-7 jars going all the time in different stages of sprouting so I have at least one jar of sprouts ready to eat each day so I need to be fast at rinsing. I always sprout alfalfa seeds so could easily use larger holes anyway. I did get these Jars in a very short time after ordering so that was nice. I have a few lids that have stainless steel screens that fill really quick and rinse in a flash but still keep the seeds in. I like those lids better.
521399,Natanya,3,"We enjoy drinking tea at home and recently had tried Forte tea while on vacation.  The Forte tea tastes like very high quality leaves which come in a pyramid style similar to these from Lipton.  However, I noticed as soon as taking these tea pyramids out of the box, the string was a little tough to completely detach.  Often when pulling the string away, it left a small hole in the pyramid.  If you are not a fan of getting little tea ""dust"" in the bottom of your cup this is a little annoying.<br /><br />But more importantly, the flavor.  The tea seems sweet all on its own, making me suspicious of what ""natural flavors"" is really about.  I enjoy the overall fruity flavor on first sip but notice soon after there is something a little ""off"", not quite an aftertaste but just enough to have doubts about the ingredients.  The concept of the pyramid to help enhance the steeping is excellent, but will likely look for higher quality loose teas in pyramid style bags to try out."

I decided to just check the price here since the idea popped in my head, but I'm appalled to see that it is $20+ for a bag with Prime, when I usually pay around $15 at the chain stores and $10 at a warehouse store for the same exact product.<br /><br />I usually buy products on Prime because they're more affordable and more convenient, but I think I will continue going a little bit out of my way since it saves me about $10."
136238,Eddie Wannabee,3,"The true test of any broth, be that in solid form, powder or liquid, is in the taste. You heat one cup of water and use it then you drink it (of course herbs, pepper, tabasco sauce, etc., can and should be added for the test, nothing wrong with little creative add ons) and once you are done you will know if this broth met the basic requirement of taste. The taste on this product is not equal to that of the competing brands. Rather sweet and of course one pays extra (I do mean extra) for the lack of salt on the preparation. I use regularly the Savory Beef and even though it is a little on the pricey side I have to admit we like it a lot. I thought that reduced sodium might be an interesting and healthy option, only to discover (a little too late) that it does not meet the taste test. It is more sweet than I am sure it would be if I was to boil a whole chicken for the broth it yields.  I suppose that this product tries hard at being good for you and maybe it is, but for the money and the quantity provided it falls short of the mark. Perhaps the regular kind might be better and when one thinks about it the reduced sodium is a relative thing. Say you are making dinner for 4 and you decide to use regular broth without any salt constraints all you would have to do is refrain from adding additional salt and your probably be okey in the sodium intake department, plus you would definitely get more honest flavor than using this product. Only four packets are included with each box and that, my dear reviewers, is like liquid gold in its value. The regular Savory include 12 per box and that is a little more encouraging when you are trying to get a nice deal. If you just boiled on cup of water and dissolved one of the packets in said water and drank it you wouldn't be able to say: ""Far out, this is one great cup of broth!"". Much too sweet to taste really like chicken broth and perhaps you might need two of the liquid gold packets instead of one, for a truly invigorating cup. Tried it, used it and hereby give it 3 Stars at the most for this delicate, sweet tasting, sodium free version of chicken flavor."

But every once in awhile I like to splurge on the pre-packaged oatmeal like I used to eat as a kid.  Sure the sugar is a little higher but nutritionally it's a much better option than other snacks. Only 160 calories per packet. Quaker instant oatmeal packets are just as good as you remember them. If there were any way to improve this product it would be to make the oatmeal a little thicker.  More like rolled oats.  Other than that,  Quaker Maple and Brown Sugar oatmeal is awesome.<br /><br />26JUL12 REVISED RATING: My kids tell me this oatmeal is really bland compared to what they are used too.

497066,Nicole S. Urdang,3,"This is a funky little product, since the liquid immediately blends with your water, no stirring required.<br /><br />One full squeeze wasn't enough flavor, for me, in a 12 ounce glass of water; but, two long squirts did the trick.<br /><br />The flavor tasted mildly real. All these drinks taste a bit artificial if you're not used to them. On the other hand, I like the extra texture they impart. It's kind of like flat soda. I know that doesn't sound appealing, but I mean it positively. It takes your water into another realm.<br /><br />In general, I find these drink add-ins make it incredibly easily to quaff a large glass of water in no time. So, if you have trouble getting all that H2O down your gullet, I would recommend this as a faster delivery system."

542672,Linda1961,3,"Celiacs need to have GF bread but I'd like to at least have some bread with eggs and milk because it would improve the taste and textue of the bread.  This bread is dry and very small.  Not large enough for a sandwich. If I'm in a hurry I'll get a Chick-fil-A grilled chicken club without the bun and add my own bread.  Can't do that with this bread because of it's size.  Also, have to add more condiments than I normally would because it's so dry.  However, it DOES make wonderful toast and I've made garlic croutons with it.  This bread also stands up well for carrying out when you might be traveling.  I toast some slices, stick them in a ziplock bag  and can use it that way.  I'll probably purchase this product again, however, if Ener-G reads this please make the bread more moist by adding eggs, milk etc. and make the slices/loaf bigger."
566462,"Cecil Bothwell ""Author of &#34;Whale Falls: A...",3,"The purpose of this product appears to be to convince parents that the only way to get children to eat vegetables is to disguise them as macaroni. Hence the noodly portion of this product is 50 percent cauliflower. Whether there are actual health benefits to ingesting heavily processed cauliflower as versus heavily processed wheat, in combination with heavily processed cheese-like topping, is not mine to say. (Kids I know who are exposed early and often to real vegetables seem to like them in their unprocessed state, and I'm sure that fresh veggies from a local farm are FAR healthier than any variant of laboratory rat food.)<br /><br />But that said, there is room in the world for mac and cheese, and this product tastes like mac and cheese. There is a slight cauliflower aroma during the boiling of pasta phase, but the cheese-like topping combined with butter and milk completely eliminates any possible confusion with actual cauliflower.<br /><br />As an employee of mine once observed, ""It's better than runnin' a nail in your foot."""
317601,MidnightRunner,3,"I received this item today bundled together in a way where I could not see the expiration date without cutting the plastic which bundled the 6 boxes together.  Mine expire 8/30 (today is 5/7).  I know that if I bought these in the store I would have at least a couple or more months of shelf life.  That said I should be able to get through them before the end of their shelf life and I would finish the rest even if they go over.  What is not cool is that the majority of groceries I have bought here are not nearly as fresh as those I would get a the store.  When I buy groceries here I expect them to be fresh, and considering Amazon's size I can't think of an excuse for getting products that have been sitting on a shelf for months.  I was unable to return (if I wanted to go to the trouble) these since they are not ""not eligible for return.""<br /><br />I gave these 2 stars for the actual product which is pretty good, but also sweet which needs to be considered if you are on a special diet.  I sometimes add them to my breakfast when I can't get something better."

My dog still will eat it, but isn't as interested as he was with the less-cooked chicken version. I will say, though, that buying in quantity makes this treat a lot more affordable."
274057,Bufster3,3,"I love Ancient Harvest Organic Quinoa.  It is well picked over for twigs, hulls and debris and has been very well rinsed.  It is ready to cook right out of the bag as it is so you can toast it in the pan before adding the cooking liquid.  That makes quinoa taste so much better.<br /><br />It is way too over priced though.  Even the way over priced Bob's Red Mill brand is quite a bit cheaper.  Quinoa of this quality should not cost more than $3.99/lb.  If you live near a Trader Joe's or a good bulk food store get your quinoa there.  Currently, here on Amazon, Arrowhead Mills comes in at about that price if you sign up for Subscribe & Save but I've heard that it is not as well rinsed which would be a problem quality wise.  Eden quinoa costs over $4/lb here but is still cheaper than Bob's Red Mill or Ancient Harvest.<br /><br />So quality wise I'd give this 5 stars but because of the poor price/value I give it 1 star, hence the 3 star review."

I love the Old World figs strung on a piece of vine; they assume the firmness and consistency of leather, but Ohhhh, the flavor!  They taste like sunshine and sweet, old trees on a sunny hillside: these taste like nothing at all. . . just stuff with tiny seeds.  They have no scent.  They are not sweet.  I take your word that they are figs, but they sure don't taste like the ones I've known."

55553,Jerry Jackson Jr.,3,"Like so many Americans I grew up eating quite a few varieties of Kellogg's cereals. The new ""Crunchy Nut"" cereal looked like it might be good so I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />To make a long story short, it's tasty but it isn't anything like what I expected ... and isn't like what is pictured on the box.<br /><br />First, Kellogg's probably needs to get rid of the individual who came up with the idea of calling this cereal ""Crunchy Nut."" Besides the fact that it's unimaginative and blandly descriptive, if you tell your friends you just ate a bowl of ""Crunchy Nut"" you're going to get some pretty disgusted looks in return.<br /><br />Beyond the unfortunate name, as soon as you pour a bowl of Crunchy Nut you'll notice that none of the pieces look as ""nutty"" the the pieces shown on the box ... not even close. The box shows pieces of the cereal covered in small chips/chunks of nuts but the actual cereal just looks like fat Cheerios with the occasional ""speck"" of what might be best described as ""nut powder.""<br /><br />Once you actually taste this cereal you'll notice that it tastes almost exactly like Corn Pops (another Kellogg's brand cereal). My wife also tried a bowl of this cereal and the first thing she said (without any coaching from me) was, ""It tastes like Corn Pops."" This isn't a horrible thing as long as you like the flavor of Corn Pops cereal, but if you purchase this cereal expecting a burst of ""crunchy nut"" flavor then you will be disappointed.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is a very tasty cereal (just like Corn Pops) but it has a horrible name, it doesn't look like the picture on the box, and it doesn't taste anything like the name suggests."

However, after getting past the expectation of a rich chocolate experience, and accepting that it was more like a trail mix bar, it was better. By the end of the bar, I had enjoyed it. Just don't think you're going to have a chocolate experience with this bar, and it will be good."

436842,Cape Kayaker,3,"I expected a little more from this tea, i.e., more robust flavor and strength.  It's a good tea, but not great.

15980,Jeff Biehle,3,"Ok, straight up--these things taste funky.  My first thought when I ate the first walnut was, ""What am I going to do with 6 canisters of these weird things?""  My wife tried one and hated it--she refuses to eat them.  But I kept trying them and began to like them (probably because I didn't want to feel I was throwing $30 down the toilet).  I can't quite give them 4 stars, because they're not THAT great.  But I sometimes have a hard time stopping myself from eating them once I start.<br /><br />It would really be cool if Emerald could duplicate the taste that Blue Diamond has accomplished for their Jalapeno Smokehouse Almonds.  Now THOSE things are awesome!  I highly recommend those, even if you're not a big fan of almonds.  I'm doubtful, however, that I'll order these walnuts again."

72572,Rabbi Yonassan Gershom,3,"Our trio of canine treat testers have mixed opinions about the palatability of this product.  Yesterday I gave one FunBite stick to each dog.  Gypsy, my female Shepherd cross, dropped hers on the floor and ignored it.  Jasmine, my female Collie cross, took hers back in her sleeping area in the indoor back porch, but come morning today, it was still untouched.  Sherlock, my male minature Schnauzer, absolutely LOVED his -- by morning he had gotten all the filling out and reduced the rawhide to a soggy chewy lump, which he has now eaten.  Of course, he's always been more of a chewer than his 2 pals, and he is also a smaller dog, so maybe it was easier for him to hold the treat between his paws?  At any rate, he will get the rest of the package eventually, but I'm not likely to buy any more.<br /><br />It's hard to say just why a dog does or does not like something.  Jasmine loves the raw eggs from my pet goose, while Gypsy will not touch them, but loves raw chicken eggs.  And all three dogs love matzah, which seems REALLY odd, since it is rather dry and tasteless.  Anyway, back to the FunBites, I guess you will just have to try them with your own dog(s) and see what happens.<br /><br />UPDATE:  After reading some of the other reviews here, I want to say that Sherlock doesn't seem to have any bad side affects from eating this, but then, he's always been something of a garbage can who eats anything (He's a rescue dog, knew serious hunger before we got him, so he is not picky about food -- ANY food.  If he had been a dog with a sensitive stomach, he never would have survived what he went through before we got him.  So he may not be a typical case here.)  But it does make me wonder if my other dogs somehow knew it was not right for them."
14045,"F. D. Gillett ""Comparison Shopper""",3,"What is ""four ears up""?  Read on, I'll explain later.<br /><br />The first thing I did when I received the Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley Treats was to read the lable.  Darn near everything is listed as organic.  Whether that is good or bad is a matter of personal opinion and personally, I don't even look for organic food for myself.  Is organic food actually healthier?  I don't know, but for the purposes of this review, that's neither here nor there.  The treats themselves are hard and crunchy and about 1"" x 2"" in size.  Each is scored so they can be broken in half.  I preferred to break them in half for all my dogs even though none would have had issues with the size.<br /><br />My house seems to revolve around my 4 rescued dogs, 2 Australian Kelpie mixes, a Yellow Lab mix, and a beautiful Heinz 57, maybe a doberman/border collie mix.  Weights run from 30 lbs to 85 lbs.  At one point in their lives, all of them had been abused and I do know for a fact that 2 had been starved.  As a result none are too picky about dog food or treats.  When presented with the Newman's treats for the first time 3 dogs took them quickly, but not as quickly as usual.  One dropped the treat and sniffed it before eating it.  My lab spent about 15 seconds sniffing before she would take it.  When given their regular brand of treats, the lab usually sniffs for just a second before taking it and the others just grab and inhale them.  At another treat time each dog was presented with 2 treats side by side on the floor, one of the Newman's and one of their regular brand.  Two dogs, including the hesitant Lab, chose their regular brand first before eating the Newman's.  The 2nd time I tried that, 3 out of four at their regular brand first.  That pretty much ended the experimentation and I just gave the Newman's treats until they were gone. One of the Kelpies actually refused the Newman's a couple of times which for him was highly unusual since he's usually the first in line at treat time. The others never did seem overly excited about eating organic but did eat them.  When we changed back to the usual brand they scarfed them down as usual.<br /><br />Now we get to the ""four ears up"".  When my four are really excited about something they will sit at full attention with their ears completely perked up.  At the treat times when they were being fed the Newman's, they initially started out with perked ears then once they found out what they were getting, their excitement faltered and they seemed somewhat indifferent.  Since there are four dogs with 2 ears each, an ""8 ears up"" would be a perfect rating where they were excited about eating or doing something.  Since, with the 2 exceptions, they never did refuse the Newman's but ate them without much excitement, these treats get a ""four ears up"" rating, pretty much middle of the road.<br /><br />If feeding your dogs organic treats is important to you, definately give thee a try.  Just be forewarned that they may be a bit on the large side for small dogs and they do seem harder and crunchier than some other brands.  Given the cost and the lackluster response from my dogs, it's highly unlikely that I'll be giving them the Newman's in the future."

It's not awful by any means, but it's not something i would find myself ever wanting again(i am not a fish kind of guy btw).<br /><br />The real deal breaker is the price. The package has VERY little squid, and it cost close to 10 dollars for the package after shipping.

240068,"B.

I love it.  Why doesn't every dog food bag have this?<br /><br />I also have to say that both of my dogs (greyhound and mix) love the food and gobble it up with relish.  But, you know, my teenagers would gobble up chips and candy and soda with relish if I let them.  It's junk food.  It may taste good, but it's empty calories.  Fine for sometimes (I mixed it in with their regular food), but not good as the only source of nutrition.<br /><br />And nutrition (or lack thereof) is the reason I wouldn't buy this food.  Just check the first 7 ingredients:  Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour, beef tallow preserved with mixed-tocopherols (source of vitamin E), rice flour, beef [and then more fillers and chemicals].  Note that beef is actually the seventh ingredient, and that corn, meal, flour, and tallow (fat)are the main ingredients.

I then began using Mio when it came out.<br /><br />""Vitamin Squeeze"" takes the enhancer game a step higher, by adding vitamin C, caffeine, and taurine.  It touts itself as an ""energy drink"", but I honestly didn't feel any bump in energy when I used it.  It has about half the caffeine of a cup of coffee.  The fruit punch flavor is tolerable, but has a ""chemical"" after taste - it's difficult to get artificial fruit flavors right and this could use some work.  The artificial colors and flavors remove it from the ""healthy"" category.  ""Vitamin Squeeze"" also requires refrigeration after it's been opened which is a little inconvenient for me at work, but not necessarily a deal breaker.  The flavor isn't overly intense; one squeeze gives a hint of fruit punch flavor but if you like a stronger flavored beverage, a lot more than one squeeze will be needed.<br /><br />All in all, it's a passable water enhancer, but I wouldn't want to rely on it as a vitamin source or even as an energy drink."

258272,Just Me,3,"I do love Celestial Seasonings tea; my comment here is on the ""retail price"" of $96.62, and even the Amazon price of $55.  There's 64 tea bags here folks. Tea bags are 20¢ each at most.  That must be some amazing box or someone's getting ripped off."
226603,low budget student,3,"The whole ensemble was good, with organic ramen noodles and pieces of tofu. The only problem I had was that it smelled strange once ready. The smell usually went away after a while (or I got used to it) but was the main disconcerting part.<br /><br />The tofu pieces are TINY and don't really taste like tofu....<br /><br />I didn't try microwaving it, as the hot water option was good with 15 min sitting time.<br /><br />After the first 3, I would separate the noodles and use them in other recipes but it would still have the same smell, so the problem was in the noodles and not the spices. A friend said that's normal in such noodles.<br /><br />Might not buy again."
311710,Marian,3,"We'd been making this bread for a long time with results that were all right but nothing to rave about.  Then we opened a mix with a packet of yeast that felt as though it had solidified.  Rather than use it and risk losing a loaf of bread, we substituted a packet of our own active dry yeast that was fresh.  What a difference it made!  The bread was lighter, fluffier and not sunken in the middle like it always is when we use the yeast that's included in the package.  Now we are using our own yeast to make this bread, which increases the cost.  Glutino's ""Perfect Rise Yeast"" is not only far from perfect, it's apparently stale and/or out of date.  The Glutino company needs to do better!"
125377,"Pam Tee ""mom,wife,fur-mom,book-blogger""",3,"Domino makes a fine sugar.  I like it.  I frequently buy it in the 5 and 10 pound bags at the store.  But when I saw these canisters I thought I'd buy some for 'backup' -- because I hate running out of 'the necessities' like sugar, flour, salt....<br /><br />In any case, I was unpleasantly surprised to find that the first canister I opened, after only two months, showed signs that the sugar had come in contact with moisture.  I took note of the lumps but didn't decide to write this review until after I opened a second container, only two weeks later, and it also showed signs that even with their transparent seals in place, that the containers were NOT air proof. The sugar was entirely usable, and that's not my complaint, but don't you also find it odd that this was the case for these coffee-canister-like containers.  As far as that goes, I don't remember having the sugar in the paper bags do this until after an extremely long period of time has passed.  Like a year.<br /><br />SUMMARY:::<br />Good sugar, but if you are planning on hording, don't count on this sugar remaining moisture free for years.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom/baker of sugary goodness"
167615,Home Studio,3,"While no worse than your average bowl of Raisin Bran, I was disappointed that I didn't find this to be noticeably better. The flavor of cinnamon could certainly be stronger (for my tastes, anyway), and the little slivers of almonds didn't really add to the ""crunch"" in any sort of meaningful way. And unlike the experience of some other reviewers, I found that this Raisin Bran got soggy remarkably fast after the milk was added, turning to slurry by the last few bites. I've definitely had other Raisin and Bran products that remained crisp longer.<br /><br />I was also a bit taken aback by the box, which holds only 14.5 ounces of cereal. It's the same height and width as the regular cereal box you'd see on the store shelf, but to hide the fact that you're not getting much cereal, the box is so skinny that I actually had trouble getting it to stand on end a time or two. And maybe this is common to a lot of cereals these days - it was just new to me.<br /><br />Overall, I've got nothing bad to say about this product...but to give it a rating of more than 3 stars, I'd have to feel like it was ""better than average"" somehow. And it simply wasn't."
43261,LovinLife,3,I was surprised to get this product and read the ingredient label which is different from the one listed on the item's description. The third ingredient is molasses which my dog can not have. I hope the ingredients are updated to avoid upset customers.

544817,H. Overton,3,"I know and agree with most other reviewers about the cats sticking their noses up at this food but unfortunately after my 18 yr old cat, Jazmen, was diagnosed with early stage kidney disease and was also diagnosed with diabetes (but with diet we have this under control) this is what the vet has recommended. I mix a little pumpkin in bc it can make her constipated. She has gotten used to it and does ""happily"" eat it now. If it prolongs her life and keeps her kidneys healthy that's all that matters to me. I do give her some Wellness pouches as treats once in awhile bc that is what she ate before and she just LOVES them. They are still relatively healthy being grain free and it is what I feed my other cats."
123725,Happy Nicky,3,"This isn't the light, flowery drink that I think of Elderflower water as. There was another brand in a dark green bottle that was really good but when I went to order this for my wedding reception, that one was not available. It's still good. But not amazing like the other one."
504354,"Bob Dog ""My Thoughts""",3,"The product is a ""granola bar"" looking silver foil packet containing nine individually wrapped candy lozenges.  Each lozenge contains 20 calories of ""sugar, corn syrup, milk, honey, and butter"" (actually labelled that way, in that order, on the wrapper).  The product is actually manufactured in Italy by the G. B. Ambrosoli Ronago company, and imported by Andre Prost, Inc. of Old Saybrook, Connecticut.  The label goes on to say that ""Honees"" is a registered trademark of Andre Prost, Inc.<br /><br />At a time when people all across America are spending $ billions on little tiny bottles of caffeine marked ""one hour energy,"" it appears that the Prost company is trying to cash in on the ""energy"" fad with a more honest approach that simply provides a blast of sugar. They have added vitamins B6, B12, and C to the product, so that three lozenges contains 100% of the daily requirement of these vitamins.<br /><br />Its very pleasant tasting.  Its got a nice mild ""honey-ish"" flavor, and the liquid honey center is a very nice reward at the end.  And I'm a person who enjoys the taste of honey and its benefits for a sore throat who is also aware of its high caloric density.  I was surprised that its only listed as the fourth most common ingredient; perhaps because honey is so much more expensive than sugar.<br /><br />For someone who normally enjoys hard candy (I'm not - my dentist advises against it.), ""Honees Energy Plus"" might be a nice addition to the product choices.  When I ordered the product, I was expecting a granola bar type experience, not a hard candy.  I suppose they are hoping people will overlook the calories to focus on the vitamins and energy.  Its a worthy idea.  Yet the candy, energy, and throat lozenge categories are all busting with product entries and are very competitive."

71769,Michael Lima,3,"Full disclosure:  I didn't try this shampoo myself.  However, my wife (and, as you will see, my daughter) did try it.  The following are my wife's comments as transcribed by me.<br /><br />Having heard a lot about Clear's products (and as the frequent sufferer of ""bad hair days""), I was looking forward to trying Clear's Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Shampoo.  Sadly, after two weeks of daily use, I can safely say that the product didn't meet my expectations.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed when I opened the bottle was the fragrant, but not overpowering, clean scent.  While the shampoo did look like thick milk, I wasn't bothered by its appearance.  Upon application, I found that the lather was abundant.  But, my first hint that the product's performance wouldn't match its presentation occurred when the shampoo's very nice scent dissipated quickly after I rinsed my hair.  The disappearing scent was matched by little, if any, volumizing, and no root boost, as evidenced by the number of fly-aways that I had after starting my use of the shampoo (equal to the number I had before using this shampoo).  I will say that my scalp didn't dry out from using the product.  But, there really wasn't any difference in my scalp's condition from before using Clear.<br /><br />I used the Clear shampoo both before and after I had a haircut, and the result was the same.  I will offer two caveats to my general observation.  First, I didn't use the Clear conditioner, or any other conditioner, with this shampoo.  It's possible that using the conditioner would have helped the shampoo's performance.  Second, while I have slightly wavy hair with medium body, my six-year-old daughter has very thick straight hair.  I tried the shampoo on her, and found her hair kept the fragrance and had a nice shine and bounce to it.  So, perhaps this shampoo works better on thicker hair.<br /><br />Overall, Clear's Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Shampoo wasn't anything special.  While I liked the scent and the lather, the results on my hair were negligible.  After all is said and done, I'll go back to my old shampoo once I'm done with this bottle of Clear."

They're all very convenient, since I can stash them in a cabinet in my office and not worry about remembering to bring something from home, or about it getting stolen from the communal refrigerator.<br /><br />The Teriyaki Chicken is quite tasty, if a bit salty. The teriyaki is nicely sweet and savory. The chicken does have a slightly odd texture, almost tofu-like, but still tastes good. I particularly like the chunks of baby corn, which somehow manage to retain their crunch."
357120,K. Mahadevan,3,I was dissappointed with the consistency of shots with these pods. Some of them are excellent while others are awful and watery. I think the packaging is very inconsistent. I would anyday use the starbucks pods- they are way more consistent
37487,jme,3,These bars taste ok.  They are edible and similar to a rice krispy treat but less sweet.  The problem with these bars are the fact that they way too small for the price.  I at least need two of these bars to feel like I ate anything.  Plus they are way too pricy for what you get.  Sorry but 3 star bar...
311725,B. Hostetler,3,"I have used this product before, and it makes a wonderful loaf of bread. But Amazon (or wherever it comes from) should really check expiration dates. While it's still in date now, I ordered 6 boxes and they all expire in 3 months! I don't bake bread THAT often, so I'm VERY disappointed, which is why I'm only giving it three stars."
415379,William Garrison Jr.,3,"I received this ""Quaker STILA"", which is advertized as a ""crispy oat cookie bar with fruit filling""; in my case, with a `blueberry' filling.  I received this `bar' just about the time of its expiration date.  It had a distinct `crunchiness' about its shell that contained the grape filling, which meet its advertized ""crispy"" bar touting.  The `crunchiness' really did not distract from the product, as it wasn't `hard' from the sense that one had to force a bit through it - just a little more crunchy that what I was expecting.  But, as it was at its expiration date, it did seem to be a little `drier' and  `off taste' to me.  The shell had a nice cinnamon dusting on it that `kicked up' the enjoyment of eating the bar.  I also enjoyed the grape filling - it's consistency was sort of like a Fig Nutin.  The box touts that there are ""100 calories Per Bar""  and ""0g Trans Fat"" -- which appears to be an appeal to the health-conscious or diet-minded eater.  Having had nothing for dinner the night before, one bar and a glass of milk quenched my immediate hunger pains on an early Sunday morning.  As I need a fuller breakfast, I need perhaps two of these to get me through the morning until lunch.  As, I don't see these cookie-bars as a replacement for my current bowl of cereal in the morning, I don't see myself in occasionally purchasing more of this product."
462506,sor,3,"Good quality and well sealed. I thought I was purchasing ground or granulated onion. This item stands for what it means ""powder"". There is a difference between powered onion and ground/granules. The texture of powder is like flour, very fine and can dry up the gravy in the meal. I made the mistake in confusing ground onion for poweder. I've learned that powdered onion does not work well for me. I'll check more careful next time. There is nothing wrong with this product, It's just not my preferece in texture."
445108,K. Kumar,3,"As I write this, there are two other reviews for this product. Both are from the earlier part of 2012. So I'm not sure if the product has changed or if the problem I state below didn't bother them.<br /><br />The chips are heavily coated in cracked pepper. In addition to the ton there is on the chips, there is an equal amount at the bottom of the package. I hope the batch we received is off! We really love the avocado oil chips and looks like the olive oil ones taste awesome as well. Now if we could only get rid of most of the pepper.....sigh."
189074,"Kerry T. Givens ""One out of five doctors""",3,"I am not a fan of the so-called ""Turkish"" dried apricots, which are too soft and too sweet for my tastes. Rather I prefer these chewier, somewhat more tart ""California-style"" apricots. However, these Sun-Maid 'cots were a disappointment. They were quite small, very dry, and at least one bag was intolerably tart---not sweet at all. One bag was also filled incorrectly---only contained two or three apricot pieces. Amazon was kind enough to ship me another. If you have a Trader Joes' near you, check out their bulk bags of dried apricots---much tastier, and more affordable too."
435740,Rachel,3,"This is good. It's not oh-my-god-I've-died-and-gone-to-Starbucks good...but good nonetheless. It's not very strong, so I've tried adding a bit of coffee. But this drowns out the ""white"" taste. I've tried using it in coffee instead of sugar, but that uses too many calories and the coffee doesn't taste much different. There are 100 calories per 2 tablespoons. I used a little more than recommended for taste, which led to me feeling sick after drinking a tall cup of it. So, I recommend just making an 8 oz. serving.<br /><br />I may try buying some syrup to go along with it. That's probably calorie overkill, however. To sum it up, I'm pretty undecided about what to do with this product."

When I opened it, it was not what I expected. It was only a 27 K-Cup Carousel! Had I wanted that one, I would have ordered it (and spend less money). Was disappointed that I did not get the item that I wanted. I am a frequent Amazon.com shopper and this was the first time I've received a wrong product."
70060,eCognition,3,"This is a pretty-tasty tea mix and I like the slim profile of the packet which allows you to pretty much stash it anywhere you want until you need it. The ""open here"" slot makes it easy to rip the end of the pouch open without having to use your teeth, but the hole that results is a little small for the tea to pass through easily, which means you got to work it through for a couple seconds, causing a little powdery mist to form outside of your drink container if you're not careful.<br /><br />At first, I thought it was the container I used to mix the tea in-or maybe that I was using tap water-that was causing this slight bitter beginning-taste to it. But it isn't either of those things. The powder just has a slight taste to it that may or may not turn you off to the drink.<br /><br />Each packet is 10 calories and 2 carbs. It says 5 calories, but if you take a second glance, that's for 8 oz of water; the full packet makes 16oz. If the directions are for 16oz of water with a small bottle of water pictured (like the kirkland signature ones from costco), then can we get a nutritional count for the whole 16oz, please? I didn't dock anything off the rating for this, given that it's printed right on the packet, but c'mon...<br /><br />Overall, a nice little product to give your bottled water some extra tasty kick. Not a fan of that first split-second it hits the palate, but if you're busy, you might not even notice."
245666,E. Perry,3,"I spent a lot of time trying to decide on a variety sampler pack of K-cups.  Reading the description of this set, I was excited to order, since there were so many flavors that I hadn't tried before.  If you read the list of flavors, it sounds great!  But...the bag I received was really lacking in excitement.  I understand that they couldn't include everything listed and that the collection might vary somewhat.  But there were NONE of the following from their list:  Rain Forest Nut, Pumpkin Spice, Mocha Nut Fudge, Island Coconut, Caramel Vanilla Creme, Mudslide, Chocolate Raspberry Truffle, Vanilla Cupcake, Pecan Praline.  Of ALL of those flavors, I would have thought ONE of them would show up.  I received SEVEN of one kind, Jamaican Me Crazy.  So, that's more than a quarter of the sampler being the very same kind.  I wish more care was taken to pack the K-cups with more thought for the customer.  I am not one of those grouchy reviewers who is never pleased with anything.  But, sadly, I was disappointed in this purchase."

338372,C. Gruver,3,"I have never experienced grey salt before, but I have been curious about it.  (My curiosity was prompted by its use by chefs and other foodies.)  Unable to find it in my local grocery store, I ordered it from Amazon.<br /><br />Since this is my first experience with grey salt, I cannot compare it to other brands.  I can tell you that it really is kind of grey in color, that the grains are large, and that the grains are moist.  As another reviewer mentioned, the moistness of the grains would probably make a salt mill not a good choice.<br /><br />I have been sprinkling it on my cooked food. The size of the grains mean that, when a bite contains a grain, you really 'experience' the saltiness of the salt.  The salt does not 'melt' too quickly into food, unless it is a liquid.<br /><br />I suppose that I do not have a sufficiently developed palate, because I do not really sense a lot of difference between grey and kosher salt in terms of taste.  Bottom line: I am glad that I tried it, plan to use it, but doubt that I buy more."

284316,Mktggirl1,3,"I am so bummed, as we have 10 of these left, and they are not cheap, but my 19 month old will not eat this flavor.  She happily eats similar purees by HappyBaby, Ella's Kitchen, and Plum Organics, pretty much daily.  She dug into these right when they arrived, but wouldn't finish the first one.  I was surprised, because she rarely turns down a pouch, but since then, she has refused to try it again.<br /><br />I tried it myself, and find this flavor to be more ""green"" tasting than the other brands.  The others are definitely sweetened more by fruit, where this one leans more toward a grass flavor.  I am guessing that we've trained our little one to prefer the sweet with the other brands, so if this is an early food, it will probably be fine with your little one.<br /><br />At any rate, you can't beat the convenience.  We carry pouches around in my purse, the car and keep a big stash on hand at home.  I feel like these are far healthier snacks, than the raisins and fruit snacks my older two ate on the run.  Considering my 19 month old has been primarily on table food for almost a year, I am shocked that she still loves the pouches so much.<br /><br />She loves the fruit flavors by this brand much more than this one."
291526,L. Mount,3,"My first taste of Davidson's Dessert Teas was the Raspberry Caramel.  It didn't taste anything like raspberries, or even caramel for that matter, but the tea still had a rich, sweet taste.  So, I bought the variety pack thinking that with such a variety of names, there would some kind of a variety of tastes.  Boy, was I wrong!!  All of the teas taste exactly the same.  How can lemon taste exactly like coconut, exactly like peach, exactly like tangerine almond, exactly like...you get the picture.  I do not recommend this set, or any of the sets.

Overall, the kids absolutely love the popcorn - it tastes even better than the movies and for under $1.00 per bag, I figure I'm getting a good deal. However, one issue I have is the large number of ""Old Maid"" unpopped kernels. I haven't used other brands, so I'm not sure what is normal, but it seems that about 20% of the kernels do not pop.

My cycle had been normal up until this point but after drinking it this month my period is 4 days early :( and I'm not happy about it. Parsley is an emmanogague and is the last ingredient on the list. Vitex can also mess up the cycles when they are normal. With a sensitive body I guess the parsley combined with the other herbs caused me to ovulate earlier in my cycle thus bringing down an earlier period. It took years to make my cycles normal and I was using this to manage the PMS and pain I get associated with my moon. Will not be using again :( 3stars for the sake of someone else's luck with it because I know I'm out of the ordinary."

It brought back memories of the gluten-filled fig newtons I had given up 3 years before. I bought a box a few months later, and was sorely disappointed. The fig-center was more like a gelatin rather than gooey and the cookie crumbled with the slightest touch. The only thing I can figure is that the first batch I tried must've been incredibly fresh. I've bought a couple of boxes since then hoping for one that tasted as fresh, but I haven't had any as good as the first one.<br />I like that they're packaged in twos for easy grab-and-go snacks and for portion control. I just have to be careful not to squish the packs in my bag...crumbled cookies! I also like the sweetness of the fig-center, but the oustide cookie part really doesn't have much flavor."

It was easy to drink and tasted nice.  But it was nothing special.  All the marketing materials and fancy write-ups about what Puerh tea is sort of set me up to expect something really special.  On the whole, the taste was quite pleasant, but I noticed nothing to set it apart from Bigelow or other name brands that are a cut above Lipton but a cut (price-wise) below Numi.<br /><br />I was disappointed that the tea didn't smell better.  With magnolia added, I expected to catch a whiff (I lived in the South for awhile, so I know magnolia).  Nothing.  It smelled like ""regular old tea.""<br /><br />My daughter (aged 17) liked it a bit more.  I think she appreciated the lack of bitterness, and she did add a half-teaspoon of sugar.

407166,A. Crafton,3,"Before I go into the thrashing of ingredients, I must admit these taste *really good*. They smell good too, when you first open them. Like actual oatmeal raisin cookies! The texture is nice and soft, with a walnut crunch. These are higher quality bars than most. Unlike most snack bars, they don't leave an unpleasant taste in your mouth afterwards. I do not like oatmeal raisin cookies, but I did enjoy eating one of these bars for testing. I actually ate the entire thing and was surprised at what a quality product it was. (Heated in the microwave--out of the wrapper-for a few seconds, it was almost like a cookie straight out of the oven!)<br /><br />Having said that; they have 24 grams of carbohydrates per bar and 2 grams of fiber. I was surprised that they only had 9 g of sugars considering the second ingredient (agave) is the equivalent to corn syrup. Yes yes I know, ""It's natural!"" But look and see how it's processed, it's no different. One has a health label and the other doesn't. For those watching their sugars, they are the same and should be noted.<br /><br />If you are on a gluten-free diet because of health reasons, you will really enjoy these bars! If you are gluten free and also sugar-free, these aren't going to be a regular item for you. If you want a delicious snack bar that tastes pretty close to homemade, and you don't label your eating style, then you will like these bars! One bar is filling and delicious. Soft raisins and crunchy walnuts, if you are going to buy ANY snack bars, these are worth the money over other grocery store products!"
271663,"Bryan J. Kautzman ""BK""",3,This is pretty good coffee in comparison to other coffee pods.  It's mellow yet strong.  My only real complaint is the faint hint of bitterness that I found with other Baronet coffee pods that I have tried.
4570,Rebekah Sue Harris,3,"The aroma of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TMV3E4"">Melitta Cafe Collection Riviera Sunset Decaffeinated Ground Coffee, 10-Ounce Bags)</a> was fairly weak. Scent, after all, is a huge part of taste, and this was disappointing.<br /><br />Even though I added more coffee grinds than the directions instructed, I found the coffee to be a bit bland. The taste was more than flavored water, but not amazingly so, with no subtle overtones. It wasn't bitter, but it wasn't much of anything.<br /><br />While I generally drink hi-test as opposed to decaffeinated, I do drink decaf at least twice a week. The <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TMV3E4"">Melitta</a> was comparable to the generic brand that I usually have.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TMV3E4"">Melitta Cafe Collection riviera Sunset Decaf</a> isn't a bad coffee, but it's not worth the money if there are other options available."
525367,Mitchster,3,"I'm a chocolate Reese's fan. I love white chocolate but not on the Reese's. After a while of eating 2 or 3, I began to taste the heavy syrup that is part of the ingredients on the white chocolate. I was disgusted after tasting syrup flavored chocolate. Instead of throwing them out I just ate the bottom part of the cups just to avoid the blotch of white chocolate on top of the peanut butter cup. I will definitely stick to the regular ones next time. I would recommend the White Kitkats.<br /><br />Packaging: I like the fact that these are small peanut butter cups because once I get back from the gym, I pat myself with 2 Reese's peanut butter cups, instead of having to eat a whole giant peanut butter Reese's. :)"

I wouldn't have purchased from this vendor if I knew it was for 6 bars.  Obviously my mistake, but one that I won't make again."

I'm not sure if this happened because it is decaf coffee, but I've never had a problem with any of the other brands and I clean my coffee maker out regularly.  I do not recommend buying the decaf version until the Timothy brand has figured this problem out.  Money wasted for sure!"
425378,"G. Yelensky ""Coffee King""",3,"It is a just an OK coffee! Very weak and has a pretty plain taste, but, it is still better than most American Coffees.

I used it in the automatic espresso machine, I guess if you grind it and make a regular drip coffee, it may be better. See and try for yourself!"
393632,B. Mantilla,3,"One of my dogs has food allergies, so buffalo (actually bison) is a good alternative to cow products. I had tried Canine Caviar California Rolls at my local holistic pet store before I purchased them here and found them to be suitable for an average chewer as a good occasional chew (lasting anywhere from 10 to 15 minutes).<br /><br />The best aspect of these treats is the price on Amazon. At my local pet store, they sold for $3.99 each. Since the price here is almost 80% off retail at less than $1.00 each, they are an extremely good deal.<br /><br />The only problem, however, is that the batch that I ordered stinks to high heaven. Don't get me wrong, I was prepared for some stinkiness, given that I have purchased these before and am aware that this is a natural animal product. These came packaged each individually wrapped in plastic, then placed in larger plastic bags, then placed in a display box and they still smell like concentrated bison sweat through the packaging. Once you open it, you will need an iron stomach to not retch. Of course, the dogs think that they are a to-die-for delicacy and relish them all the more.<br /><br />I believe that the manufacturer probably needs to allow these to dry out a little more before packaging them. All of the individual wrapping may actually be sealing in moisture that is causing the excessive stink. If the manufacturer were to address the smell by drying them out more, adjust the packaging and include desiccant packs, I would definitely become a repeat customer.  However, I'm not sure that the amazing price is worth the stench of these. I will probably go with another product once we've gotten rid of these California rolls."
234262,Auntie Ruth,3,"This flavor is not as good as the caramel. It is more of a dark chocolate flavor, not so sweet and sometimes I forget about the raspberry while trying to balance the chocolate and sweetness. I use more of it and probably should just add some sugar"
326619,"ZaZosMom ""ZaZosMom""",3,"I ordered this based on the positive reviews but I can't say it was that great. It tasted like a regular cup of coffee...not robust or very flavorful. I do use cream and stevia so this affects the taste..perhaps those who prefer black coffee would like it. My favorite decaf K-Cup is Emeril's Jazzed Up...great flavor, full-bodied..PERFECT! So, if someone served me the Timothy's, I wouldn't complain but having compared it to Emeril's Jazzed Up...I'll stick with Emeril's."

I can let that go as I know that that adds calories, but at 250 calories/cup watch the amount of cheese you add.  I just feel like for that many calories, it should be a bit thicker.  It is pretty tasty though and I love that it's low in sodium."
149914,K. Angus,3,"There was no ingredients listed for this product so I purchased anyway thinking all Instant Milk is basically the same, wrong: This stuff was hard to mix and must have been 25% sugar. I ended up giving all 4 pounds I purchased away, seller would never respond to my request of an ingredients list."
530217,Dana Shulps,3,I purchased these because I love sour gummy worms and so my order would qualify for free shipping.<br />These gummy worms are the most sour I've had and the sour sugar on them is thick which at times overpowers the fruit flavors.<br />I also felt that these were a bit tough but not stale. The fruit flavors were all very enjoyable except I thought that the blue (raspberry) had a different taste to it then I am used to.<br />This is a good quality product but doesn't suite my tastes. If you are looking for a sour gummy worm that has more sour power than Trolli brand this could be for you.
6877,sharkychick,3,"I enjoyed the product very much.  I like that it is not overly sweet or heavy.  There is no aftertaste and it goes down smoothly with just enough carbonation to give it body.<br /><br />The tangerine/orange taste I found to be clean.  If you like something that is sweeter, this might not be for you.  But if you enjoy the fruity taste with some carbonation it is quite nice.  I drank it chilled.  I don't think I would have enjoyed it at room temperature.<br /><br />The price might keep me away.  Almost a dollar per 8oz can is kind of tough.<br /><br />Four stars for taste and two stars for price = three stars."

198187,Adam's Mom,3,"I have used Melitta porcelain coffee makers since the mid 70s. It indeed makes a perfect cup of coffee. I can relate to the family who took their pot on vacation because no coffee compared...I've done the same! No electric coffee maker compares to the taste...especially in the porcelain pot.  After having broken the handle on my cone, my husband bought me a new set as a gift. Unfortunately it did not drip as well, making brewing a hassle. Then I noticed that the new set was made in China and was bulkier compared to the original German-made product which was significantly finer in both quality and looks.  This was about 8 years ago. Since, I have been using a single cup, plastic Melitta cone. Das Ultimate Brewing Machine will never be the same...unless they have gone back to being German crafted. FYI, when I need to make more than 1 cup, I still use my old broken pot. The newer one having been sold in a garage sale."
544277,Tall Mom with Big Feet,3,"We have a small dog (17 lbs) and she could not get started on these - they were too hard to bite.  Once we cut them in half (which is quite hard to do!) she was able to get at them and then really enjoyed them.  We probably wouldn't buy them again, since we were looking for something that she could work on and enjoy for a long time, and it didn't really work for that.  Either she couldn't eat it at all, or she could eat it too quickly once we cut it in half."

Its not terrible, I don't dislike it but I guess I expected something with a bit more flavor. It is a nice change from the typical iced teas so i'll enjoy this change till I run out of mix. I'm not sure if i'll buy it again but maybe if its on sale. Haven't seen it in the stores yet either so this must be real new."
45551,Silea,3,"You have to love ginger to like this product. It's not a ginger-flavored drink, it's a ginger drink.<br /><br />I admit, i only like ginger, i don't love it. I found the flavor to be too strong, and too bitter. I had to add a fair amount of sugar to make it drinkable. Never once did i notice any lemon flavor.<br /><br />As with most drinks, it's going to be up to each individual to decide if they like it. Ginger-philes will probably love it, ginger-haters should stay well clear, and people somewhere in between might like it with a bit of honey or sugar."
88685,Nettie Scott,3,"I like Spaetzle.  They go nicely with many main dishes and are good in basic soups as well.  Bechtle's are cut very small, which makes them less of a plump, cushiony noodle like a true home-made spaetzle might be.  I thinik it is a matter of personal preference, but I tend to prefer a larger, longer noodle.  Noodles are to hold onto gravies and sauces and this one is adequate but not as satisfying as other brands."
23243,Jeff Williamson,3,"BEWARE!! As usual everything about the deal went great because of Amazon; prompt delivery, etc., etc. However, this coffee will expire in less then 3 months. So, clearly, this has been sitting around somewhere. I buy other Kirkland coffee's at my local Costco and they usually don't expire for 12 to 18 months. Unfortunately, the Kirkland Espresso hasn't made it to the East Coast (last year or so far this year), at least not at the Costco's around me, and I wanted to try it, since, even at this inflated price it's priced about the same as 2 pounds of Lavazza, etc.<br /><br />So, hopefully it will be fine when I open it, but don't buy this expecting to use it this winter!"
328234,Mary Acosta,3,"The price per pound seemed worth the value to try this product.

This gum may be great for my teeth, but it doesn't pack much punch for re-flavoring your mouth.  It's always been a problem for the fruity gums while the mint-based gums always seem to last a lot longer.  Probably because they have flavorful oil in them while I suspect this brand to have a little flavor and mostly sugar substitute.<br /><br />It's similar to the orange tic-tacs - they taste good, but they don't solve the breath problem."
179208,"Alice McDaniel ""Alice""",3,"I ordered these and was excited about them.  They were okay but 12 bags of them was too much for just myself.  The flavor was okay.

538416,"Laura Probst ""dragon wench""",3,"I love English Breakfast tea, and robust, full-flavored, almost malty without being bitter is how I'd describe the ideal blend.  Sadly, while the Higgins & Burke blend isn't the worst, I wouldn't say it's ideal.  Firstly, it's far from robust, almost weak when brewed according to the given directions of using one tea bag to brew a single cup of tea.  Secondly, it has a slight tannic/bitter aftertaste, not enough to be off-putting, but enough to be noticeable even for a tea novice.  That said, the Higgins & Burke blend has a slight floral/fruity flavor just at the edges, which is unusual for an English Breakfast blend; perhaps the weaker nature of the blend explains the ability to detect such a delicate flavor.<br /><br />Though the faint floral/fruity notes are an interesting flavor addition, they don't make up for the slightly bitter aftertaste, and while I can appreciate, even admire the ethically and ecologically friendly nature of the Higgins & Burke label, I'd like to have a tasty tea in addition to a clear conscience.  So I think I'll stick with my usual EB blend from Twinings and give a skip to the Higgins & Burke blend."

515923,GC,3,"I bought Chocagave based on the rave reviews and ""healthy"" claims (based on being organic, raw, and using ""natural"" sweetener). It really is very tasty as a chocolate syrup and excellent for making hot chocolate. It's fairly liquid, so drizzles well on top on dessert, while not being watery (for example, I think Hershey's syrup seems runny as well as tasting yucky).<br /><br />The unfortunate part comes in the ""natural"" raw agave syrup used in this chocolate. Yes, I'm sure it's organic and raw like the maker claims BUT I've recently started reading about how UNNATURAL agave nectar really is. Agave is apparently a created sweetener concocted sometime in the 1990s by manufacturers using the same process as high fructose corn syrup, except with the starchy part of the agave plant rather than corn. As a result, agave nectar is made up of same unhealthy fructose (a higher percentage than high fructose corn syrup) that experts claim increases obesity, insulin resistance, etc, etc. (You've probably heard the arguments if you're looking for more natural sweeteners because you do believe high fructose corn syrup is bad).<br /><br />So, fructose might be a low glycemic sweetener, but I'm disappointed that the healthier alternative chocolate syrup that I bought isn't as healthy as I thought it would be. Sure, it's chocolate dessert and should be used in moderation but I was not aware that agave syrup being a ""natural"" alternative is mostly hype.<br /><br />Know what you're buying and DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH on whether this is a good choice for you. It might be great for a diabetic without any other good options (since I think fake sweeteners taste funny and are probably even unhealthier). For me, I don't think it's really worth the additional expense to buy something I know isn't necessarily any healthier than organic chocolate with real sugar."
63665,"Ty Arthur ""xFiruath""",3,"A hot cup of coffee (preferably with creamer or foamed milk) is my preferred way to start the day, but I thought I'd try out one of the cold coffee drinks just to see what I'd been missing. The product description uses the phrase ""Full-bodied,"" which is definitely an understatement; despite the high sugar content, a can of illy issimo's Caffe has an extremely bitter flavor that's almost biting.<br /><br />The first sip almost stopped me cold in my tracks because it was rather unpleasant at first, but like coffee in general, it takes a little while to start to really appreciate the flavor. There's a bit of a sweet aftertaste from the sugar, and the coffee itself will appeal to anyone who likes a darker roast. On the energy front, you will get a serious caffeine jolt just from one can.<br /><br />I still prefer a cup of hot coffee with creamer, but this isn't a bad on-the-go choice for anyone who likes a darker, more bitter flavor and doesn't mind iced versions of coffee."

I drink all of my coffee through the French Press method, so keep that in mind when reading my review.<br /><br />At roughly 9.60/lb I was expecting reasonably decent coffee. As anyone who drinks coffee knows, coffee has gotten pretty expensive over the last year or so. I judge all my coffee based primarily on taste as well as taste/cost. For a frame of reference, I love Peets coffee, but the cost is simply too much to make it worthwhile for me to enjoy drinking it all the time. Most of the Peets blends I enjoy cost roughly 14-15/lb.<br /><br />The description of the coffee states ""medium roast, chocolate notes."" I would say this coffee is most definately a medium roast - and it may even verge on being a medium light roast, at least the beans I got. In terms of chocolate notes, I haven't had a mocha-java style coffee in awhile, so I am not an expert on chocolate notes in coffee. But, I could not really taste any subtle chocolate notes in the coffee. Maybe it was the French Press method of preparation, I do not know.<br /><br />Overall, I have a hard time rating this coffee. For the price, I wanted it to be better than it is. But when I think about price again, for a ""really good"" I would have to pay 50% more than this price.<br /><br />I think if I could, I would give it like 3.5 or 3.8 stars."

263667,"Brian J. Laws ""DreamRycher""",3,"A friend of mine told me about Marmite and how it's chalk full of vitamins and such and that the British eat this stuff on toast with their breakfast.  So being somewhat adventurous when it comes to food, I thought I'd give it a try.  I read a bunch of other reviews on here both good and bad so I felt I was properly prepared for what I was facing.  I ordered it and it arrived very quickly in a larger box than I was expecting and it was bubble wrapped to the hilt!  Peeling off layer after layer (after layer, after layer) I finally got down to the center . . . and I started to think this was a joke!  It's an incredibly tiny container!<br /><br />So I had read that this is some powerful stuff, so I open it up and just dab my pinky in it for a quick taste.  WOW, that is some strong stuff!!  Those other reviews weren't kidding!!!  It's also kind of sticky, like a consistency that reminds me of honey (so be careful what it touches, because it's likely to remain there).  So the next morning I make some toast and LIGHTLY spread some Marmite on there and tried it . . . still strong, so I put butter on there as well.  Not bad but the strong, salty taste of the Marmite definitely hangs on.  On another piece of toast I again put a light amount of Marmite on there and then covered it with honey . . . not bad with the combo of salt and sweet.<br /><br />I've done this for a couple of weeks now, and I can see why the container is so small.  Using small amounts it hardly looks like I've made a dent in it at all.  I can't say I'm a big fan, but it's definitely an acquired taste that I'm not sure I'll acquire by the time I finish the tiny container off!"

You may love them.  I found them acceptable but not outstanding.  It all depends on your particular taste.  For me they were a bit too sweet and they are certainly very high in calories."

Since then, I have found nothing similar until I saw that Pillsbury came out with a sugar-free mix. I expected it to be similar but I was very disappointed. The Better Crocker mix tasted great--like regular brownies but not as sweet. The Pillsbury mix has a odd texture and they apparently went way overboard with the Splenda. I thought this would be an adequate substitute for my much-missed BC mix, but I think it is awful and I won't be buying it again."

The price was suspiciously low so I thought I'd give it a try with the hope of finding an affordable alternative.<br /><br />Unfortunately this simply doesn't measure up even to that of the Frontier brand. While the packaging is STRONGLY preferred...this simply wasn't fresh enough. The flavor was a bit more mild and it required more than double the quantity I've been using for a simple rice dish with the other brand.<br /><br />Notice the expiration date...2017. As of this writing in early 2010 it is good to know the use by date is not near. On the other hand, a seven year window leaves something to be desired.<br /><br />Bottom Line - Preferred packaging but less fresh than ""other"" brand sold here on Amazon.

That's because it was NASTY! Definitely didn't like this one. I mean, It wasnt so bad that I threw it away. I still ate it, but I wont ever buy the Spinach one again.<br /><br />Don't let me sway your decision to buy Kitchens of India products though. The ones I did like tasted better than most Indian restaurants I have been to. And I've been to quite a few. Not to mention it is much cheaper than going out to a restaurant by far!<br /><br />And if you live on the north eastern USA and have a Wegmans near you, they just started making different kinda of packaged Naan breads which are also very good (they are not vegan though sadly).<br /><br />I've ordered a 6 pack of the Kidney Bean curry, lentil curry, and chick pea curry because I liked them so much. And thankfully out of the 6 choices in this multi pack, the 3 that I like the best have the lowest amount of fat and sodium, which seem to be very high in all of Kitchens of India products. Especially the Sodium. So be careful, and eat them in moderation as I do.<br /><br />Hope this helps!"

This is not nice to chew either. Normally the partially popped ones are the best flavor but these are chewy and so dense they don't budge, wind up in the trash.<br />Still looking for my popcorn."

45861,Talvi,3,You'll probably like this if you like ginger - it does have a strong ginger taste that often lingers afterwards in the form of an aftertaste.  The lemon provides an interesting counterbalance to the ginger - upon first sip it overpowers the ginger but the subtle ginger flavor often comes back as an aftertaste.  Some may prefer the aftertaste and others may not.<br /><br />What I do like is that it is an interesting and different alternative to the more common tea flavors we get in America. It definitely has a very strong Asian smell and taste that will either attract or detract.  I would say it's a matter of taste and to try just one box before buying a group.  My spouse loved the tea but I didn't care for it.
313291,JChain,3,Pricey yet convenient. Variety is nice for the new customer to sample. Occasional undesireable results do to clogging. May be a result of the bottled water that we are restricted to in a forward deployed unit in Afghanistan or the frequent use of the Keurig by multiple users.

148883,Joanna,3,"I think this machine is nice and the steam and blend cycle is nice but it takes an insignificant amount of extra time to dump food from basket directly into the blending container in the Beaba.  So as far as this difference I don't really think it is significant enough to go with the Brezza.  Beaba now makes a larger machine also.  I guess the cost is a little less for the Brezza but because of the disadvantage I am about to mention it absolutely does not work for me!  I chose the Beaba because you cannot put your jar or small glass container right into the Brezza to defrost or reheat like you can with the Beaba because of that middle rod that is part of the blades.  It is completely in the way in my opinion and they force you to use their plastic containers to store and reheat food!  I freeze my baby food in these tiny glass lock containers because I try to use glass when I can for storage.  I also buy the glass organic pre made baby food when I don't have time to cook as a backup and I need to be able to warm those since the baby doesn't eat the whole jar yet so I store left overs in the refrigerator.  You can put the jars and the glass containers directly in the Beaba basket to defrost and heat and I could not use the Brezza to do it.  I would have to defrost at room temp or in fridge then transfer to heat which takes way too long and I would have to transfer to the brezza containers which are plastic and then heat.  Not only this is completely time consuming (I do not use the microwave it irradiates your food, destroys nutrients and it is horrible!) it is also plastic and even though BPA free I am trying to avoid plastic like I mentioned so just steaming and blending in plastic is already too much for me so for storage I use glass only.  So this is a good machine but if you are looking for defrost/reheat function where you can put your own containers and jars into this machine will not work."

I used a lot and mixed with vegetable oil as it says but still not very strong flavor.

I received these cookies in Central Florida via US Postal mail at the end of March. The package was brought to the door so it spent no time heating in the mailbox. Just the few days in transit caused every single cookie to melt to some degree and stick quite badly in the plastic dividers they rest in. It took several hours in the 'fridge to cool them down and even then a not insignificant portion of the chocolate coating was left behind on the packaging.<br /><br />I would hate to see what these would have looked like or the mess that they would have made in July or August. I like these cookies and will probably buy them again but I'll do so at the local grocery store. Think before you order. Chocolate melts!

254934,"A. Toll ""Snackin' Nut""",3,"Tortuga has been a standard in commercially prepared rum cakes and is very popular.  They are manufactured oversees in the Caribbean (Cayman Islands) and this is reflected in its $35 MSRP price. I have enjoyed these cakes on several occasions.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1. They are moist with a deja vu hint of Tortuga rum-The original is the best in my assessment.<br />2. The cakes are packaged nicely to avoid damage in transit and sealed well to lock in moisture.<br />3. They taste good and are well balanced, pairing nicely with ice cream.<br />4. These are basically presented as rum-flavored Bundt cakes-fluted and sectioned for slicing.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1. These cakes are extremely over-priced. For the price, you could not only prepare a far better and higher quality cake but also afford to lace it with a generous bath of rum.<br />2. Conventional ingredients-bleached white flour, aluminum, partially hydrogenated oils, preservatives and artificial food colorings and dyes.  This is apparent when you slice into the cake and need to grab your sunglasses from the bright yellow color of the cake-that's yellow dye folks...not gold rum! I can assure you...There's no gold in dem 'dere mills!<br />3. The walnuts on top of the cake are sparse.<br />4. You will need an electron microscope to measure the amount of rum in this cake.<br />5. The cake is very one-dimensional and could use a good rum icing to complement the flavor and complete this treat.<br /><br />The Bottom Line:  If you have the time, make your own for the best rum cake available.<br />  If all you make are reservations, then get the cake and ask Marie Antoinette to pay for it!"

I usually drink a jasmine green tea and it's much more delicate than this. I'd compare the Numi to a black tea in its robustness. Also, I am not really sure what a magnolia blossom tastes like, but I didn't detect anything floral about this tea either in aroma or taste. There's a kind musky note to the flavor, but that's it.

I like the original, the Chocolate Little Bites (addicting), Touch of Fruit in the Middle that I wish didn't have the frosting on top as it's sweet enough from the fruit. I also love cinnamon-flavored food including cinnamon rolls.<br /><br />The cinnamon flavor in this cereal is less on the sweet side and more on cinnamon's bitter side. It also tastes artificial. The label says it uses natural and artificial cinnamon flavoring. Is cinnamon really that expensive that the cereal has some artificial flavoring?<br /><br />This has 6g of fiber -- above my minimum required of 3g from cereal. Surprisingly, the cereal didn't fill me up long enough until the next meal. The biggest question is the cinnamon ""roll"" part. This is more like cinnamon whole grain wheat. No signs of a cinnamon roll.<br /><br />As for the sweetness level, I'd say it's about in the middle. Cereals like Lucky Charms and Honey Nut Cheerios are sweeter cereal than this. But this is sweeter than original Cheerios, Corn Flakes and Crispix.<br /><br />I don't plan to buy this. There are better cereals out there."

All I taste on the pizza is this sauce, it overpowers the pizza in its entirety.  It is a darker color too, not a bright red.  It has romano cheese in it, so perhaps it is overpowering the sauce.  I prefer Gia Russa, Cento, and Don Pepino...no cheese in those sauces, so I suspect it is the cheese that I prefer OUT of the sauce.  You can always sprinkle some on the pizza to taste.  I also like that the other three brands are allergen free so I can use it safely for my granddaughter who has nut, egg and dairy allergies.  Don Pepino does not contain citric acid (a preservative) which keeps the tomato taste clean and authentic tasting. I will probably use this sauce on occasion but most probably more as a regular sauce in Bolognese, meatloaf, etc.."

203828,"Justine A. Lee ""Dr. Justine Lee""",3,"Zuke's produces some great products. Recently, I tried the ""Natural Purrz"" healthy moist cat treats (Savory Salmon flavored). The nice things about these treats is that they are low-calorie (only 2 calories per little moist treat). Also, Zuke's products are made with high quality protein and grains, and all ingredients come from the US (Made in the USA!). That said, these small treats remind me of my cat's monthly Heartgard medication - it's only palatable to some cats. Seamus, my fatty tabby, likes these, but not as much as the Greenie crunchy treats. Echo, my svelt black cat, won't touch these moist treats. Overall, they are a great option for a low-calorie treat, but use in moderation. It also comes in a ""tender chicken"" flavor.<br /><br />The active ingredients in Natural Purrz (Savory Salmon) include: salmon, barley flour, rice flour, vegetable glycerin, malted barley, tapioca, gelatin, water, menhaden fish oil, brewer's yeast, natural flavors, lecithin, cultured whey, acetic acid, salt.

Unfortunately, I was wrong. It can best be described as Corn Flakes meets Honey Nut Cheerios, which sounds great in theory, but it just didn't do it for me.

I much prefer the cookies and cream variety. They aren't very big. Maybe about have the size of a playing card and half as thick as a deck.

373384,"E. A. Jones ""movie buff""",3,"The description of the tea on the package made me think there would be something espresso-like in the tea, when there really wasn't.  It's a strong red (black) tea in what is allegedly an espresso grind, but tea doesn't really grind the way coffee beans do and so it just makes a lot of very small, hard to filter bits.<br /><br />This grind of tea needs to be in an espresso machine or else you will get floaties.  I tried this tea three ways: espresso, regular drip coffee, and loose in boiling water and strained later.  It had to be strained 3 times to get most of the floaters out of it, and while I'm okay with some actual tea leaves in other brands occasionally making it into the cup, this fine grain floaty stuff really put me off for some reason.  When you make it as you do espresso coffee, however, you really concentrate the taste and it becomes nearly undrinkable.<br /><br />The taste was the same every time, very strong, bitter to the point of smelling a bit dirty, with an acidic sweetness that lingered on the tongue for ages.  My husband grabbed the grounds the first time and literally ran them outside, and immediately cleaned the coffee pot to make sure the taste did not affect the machine later.  He adamantly refused to even be in the house when I attempted the tea twice more.<br /><br />For people like us who like nothing in our tea except maybe a little lemon, a tea like this that must be doctored heavily isn't really our thing anyway.  But one of the reviews here recommended the tea for Thai Iced Teas, which I tried.  That was the best result of the 3 attempts at using the tea, but I still like the kinds of teas you can get in restaurants or international food stores much better than this tea.<br /><br />We're big tea drinkers in this house, and at any given time have at least 7 types of tea in the house.  I really don't believe our dislike of the tea was a case of unfamiliarity.  The price is also quite a lot, considering we often buy our tea online at gourmet shops for $7-$10 per 4 oz."

I tried to show them that pulling the rope would cause the treats to come out but alas they just werent understanding. It has been almost twoo weeks now and still not much results. They love the other Premier toys, just arent quite smart enough for this one."

139258,"C Wahlman ""cdub""",3,"First of all, this is not easy to use.  My manna shifted during packaging or shipping, so it was a solid chunk on the side of the jar.  I put it in a hot water bath and stirred and chipped away, but it took about 15 minutes of my husband stirring frantically to get the top liquefied to a spreadable state.  The bottom would not soften for the longest time for some reason.  After that bit of chaos, I was hoping for something really special.<br /><br />I was disappointed.  We tried our manna on pancakes (which is a great fiber filled option for a sweetener, instead of syrup).  The gritty texture and not quite sweet flavor was off-putting to me.  My husband loved it, but agreed it was gritty.<br /><br />I also dipped some chunky granola in it.  I found the texture and flavor easier to eat on the granola.<br /><br />We will continue to use it, but we know to prepare a bit of time to get this ready."

The Peach variety has a very strong black tea flavor and very light on the Peach taste.  It is labeled a sweet tea, but it is not that sweet.  With only 15 grams of sugar, it is a lot less than 39 grams of sugar in a soft drink.  What I would like to see is a blend of black and orange pekoe teas to soften the straight bitter black tea flavor.  This is also true for the Raspberry Iced Tea.  My favorite is the Half and Half, a mixture of tea and lemonade."

I'm only rating 3 stars because I got six boxes and every box had approximately 75% of the cookies broken/crumbled.  The recipe abviously needs to be tweaked.  That being said, I too find it difficult to not eat a whole box in one sitting.  I eat them with a spoon! They'd probably be very good sprinkled over vanilla ice cream - gotta try that.  I love the flavor of these cookies, but hope that Pamela's fixes the recipe so they don't crumble in transit (or upon the first bite if you are lucky enough to get a cookie that is completely intact).

The decaf showed up right away, no problem as usual.  A week later when our TW Breakfast Blend showed up, I opened the cardboard packing box to find 50 k-cups.  That's it, just the K-cups, no packaging, wrapping or anything.  Usually you get 2 boxes of 25 or whatever.  We open one box and put the other away for storage.  Okay, so now I have no place to store this lovely brown packaging box with my 50 loose k-cups.<br /><br />I know it sounds petty but it was just weird.

I specifically chose this product because it said a count of 240, as opposed to 5 pounds.  (I have no idea how many worms is in 5 pounds and I needed about 2600).  While we only counted a couple of the boxes out, I know that the final bag count indicates each box averages 10-15% short on worms (24-40 worms per bag).  I ended up running out when I should have had a couple hundred extra.  Quality of the worms was good though."
39408,MyPenName,3,"For the past few months, my local Dollar Tree has been carrying various versions of Rockstar. This delighted since I drink it regularly. I was even more so delighted to come across some Rockstar coupons which brought the price down to 45 cents a can when bought at Dollar Tree. I stocked up. Eventually they started running out of Original Rockstar, which is what I usually drink. I needed to stock up again and didn't want to pay full price, so I grabbed a few of these sugar free versions to hold me over until they got more original in stock.<br /><br />I do not like them at all as much as the original and here is why -<br /><br />  The sugar free version has that diet soda taste, which I kind of expected, but was hoping it wouldn't have.<br /><br />  It also has a little less carbonation. One of the things I love about original Rockstar is that it has that powerful,<br />  crisp carbonation, so I really miss it with the sugar free.<br /><br />  I find that the sugar free version actually bloats me alot more than the original.<br /><br />I have become pretty much immune to Rockstar as far as energy goes, but I love the taste (of the original) and so I drink one every morning, just like other people drink coffee. I suppose I am ""addicted"" to it just like people are ""addicted"" to coffee, too.<br /><br />If you don't mind the diet soda taste, or if you have tried original Rockstar and think it's too strong, you would probably like these quite well. I feel like this one has less energy benefits too."

Natural Value has no fillers or preservatives and tastes great which means it is perfect for making healthy coconut yogurt with the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004SUHY"">Salton YM9 1-Quart Yogurt Maker</a>.  If you haven't tried making coconut yogurt yet I highly recommend it!<br /><br />A lot of people are still under the impression that Coconut milk is bad for you.

If you are one of those people that still think coconut is bad I recommend reading <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1416569502"">The Good Fat Cookbook</a> to help set the record straight."
497107,"Nickolas X. P. Sharps ""Fleet Strike 13""",3,"Mango Peach isn't the worst of the beverage enhancing MiO products, but it certainly isn't the best. Alone the taste is a little much, the good thing about Mango Peach however is that it is more versatile than the other flavors. You could drink Mango Peach just mixed with plain water. Or you could add it to teas, lemonades, or mixed drinks. Some complain that MiO isn't cost effective but that would only be the case if you use a heavy dose with each mixing. I'd say with a standard squeeze you can get about 20 drinks out of MiO, it all really depends on the amount of flavor you desire. The small, easy to carry packaging makes MiO far more convenient than a bunch of little Crystal Light packs. As a product overall I give MiO five stars, as Mango Peach I can only give it about three."

I lose approximately one piece a pack by pressing just the wrong way and having the gum shoot out of the package like a cannon, forever lost.<br /><br />The gum itself is decent, lasts for slightly less than a twenty five minute car drive, packs a comfortable punch, and improves breath. Still, it's not outstanding, and doesn't overcome the poor packaging, so won't be buying any more."
444079,Mariel,3,"I have always loved black turtle beans and eat them often. I was happy to learn of Eden Organic and the no-BPA can. As others reported, the shipment arrived very badly dented. Wasn't thrilled with that, but okay. Stuff happens. The real disappointment came when I opened the first can. I actually thought I had opened a can of kidney beans by mistake.<br /><br />These are not traditional black turtle beans. I don't know what kind of bean they are, but if you are looking for the traditional black turtle bean, this is not it. And it's not just the reddish brown color that gives these away - even the taste is unlike traditional black beans.<br /><br />They don't taste bad, just more along the lines of a kidney bean taste instead of a black bean. I know there are other types of black beans and maybe this is one of those. But the can says black turtle beans and those they certainly are not."
271431,marquis,3,"I grew up in an Italian neighborhood, so maybe it's not fair to compare these shells to what I'm used to from the local bakeries.  But I'm finding them to be a little too thick.  Cannoli shells can't be too delicate or they will fall apart in your hands while filling or eating them.  But to me, these Ferraro shells cross over the line into being too thick, and that detracts from the experience.<br /><br />And I also don't find them to be as tasty as other shells.  They don't taste bad, but the flavor of the shells is very neutral.  I'm used to shells that bring a little bit of zesty flavor to the cannoli party.<br /><br />Since Amazon only sells them in these multi-unit packs, maybe they'll grow on me as I work my way through them."
6716,Gaz Rendar,3,"When I tried a can of Switch Orange Tangerine I was expecting to taste something similar to Orange Crush or Sunkist soda.  Switch is actually quite different.<br /><br />Switch claims that it doesn't add any extra sugar or common additives found in most mainstream sodas.  And when you taste it, I believe them.  Since it doesn't have the added refined sugar of an Orange Crush-type soda, Switch comes across with a subtly harsher, more acidic taste. This can of Switch tastes like...well...carbonated orange juice.  To me, this is a good thing.  I enjoyed the flavor and found it tasty and pleasantly unique.<br /><br />Given all that, I would absolutely buy this product all of the time if it wasn't for the unfortunate price.  These cans are only 8.3 ounces and cost close to $1 per can.  That's a heck of a lot more than the $0.25-$0.33 you pay for a 12 ounce can of mainstream soda (when purchased as a typical 12 or 24 pack).<br /><br />I love the taste of this stuff, I love that it doesn't have all kinds of extra refined sugar, and I hate the price.  I want to buy it, but I just can't afford it and have to drop it to 3-stars on that merit alone.  Too bad."

157092,"P. MSakamoto ""boy clothes""",3,"Melitta Hazelnut Creme Brulee is a decent coffee, but not a great coffee. I like coffee that is a bit stronger, fuller and smells like full roast coffee. This coffee actually does smell like vanilla, cream and hazelnuts with a hint of caramel. It smells like a specialty coffee drink at Starbucks or better. The issue I have is that the taste doesn't live up the smell. It tastes like a pretty normal medium roast coffee. That is not to say it's bad. I will finish off the pack, but will probably use most of it for company that prefers this sort of thing.<br /><br />For my own personal taste, I like full roast coffees, black with no sugar. Peet's French Roast (yes, I know it is sorta ""burnt"" to some of you). What I really, really like are artisan roasted beans from small shops or from Italy and France. One of my favorites is Castroni, from Rome. This is all to say that this coffee is drinkable, but if not for the Amazon Vine review process, I would not have bought it myself.<br /><br />For a better cuppa from Melitta, try the ""Blanc et Noir"" which is somewhere between medium and full roast. Very smooth and satisfying and you can share it with those who like somewhat less than full-on strong coffee."

However, when I brewed it; using exactly the same bean volume, grind, and water volume as I do with the Reach; it just isn't as good.  It has a weak, almost slightly sour flavor.

Frozen ramen from any Asian grocery store costs about the same as this stuff and does taste 10 times better. Korean ramyun (various brands) also costs about the same and tastes much better, especially if you like spicy foods. And of course none of these instant noodles tastes anywhere near as good as the ramen in a half decent Japanese restaurant."

184944,Coldsteel7,3,"I like a good cup of Vietnamese coffee.  I use either a coffee press or a Vietnamese filter depending on how much of a hurry I am in.  I have two boxes of Trung Nguyen coffee, which I don't really use.  The coffee is a little bit bitter for my taste.  While the bitterness of Vietnamese coffee is cut by the sweet silkiness of sweetened condensed milk, this coffee bean is still manages to bite.  Fixing the coffee with Cafe DuMond provides a rich experience without the bitterness.<br /><br />I can get Trung Nguyen at an International market near my house.  However, if you buy it online, expect to pay excessive shipping charges.  Before this store opened, I had to pay nearly as much for shipping as the actual coffee.  So a ten dollar box of coffee will set you back another ten for shipping.  Ridiculous.  Be aware of that if you decide to order online.<br /><br />The cost of Trung Nguyen is actually pretty good compared to most other specialty coffees (when you don't have the shipping component).  I can get it at my local market for $6.99.  The online prices normally range right around ten dollars.  Any good coffee brand is going to run around ten dollars per pound.  This brand is just shy of one pound, at fifteen ounces.  The seven dollars I pay locally is a steal.  It is just too bad that the bean bites more than I like.<br /><br />Trung Nguyen is excellent if you like to fix Vietnamese coffee.  I you enjoy a bean that has an extra bitterness, then this is just right for you.  It is a mixture of several beans, which is a by-product of the micro-climates that affect growing in Vietnam.  If you like something a little milder, use Cafe DuMond.  The chicory adds a pleasant chocolate quality without the harshness.  Three stars."

Illy is not new to the coffee world and some of their beans produce delicious coffee.  Its not surprising they decided to branch out to the portable market.  In doing so, they have joined forces with Coca Cola, likely because of their ability to mass market as well as produce an inexpensive canned product.<br />A cappuccino to an Italian is generally one third espresso, one third steamed milk, and one third foam.  Obviously the steamed milk and foam would be impossible in a chilled can.  But this is meant to be the chilled version of that drink.  Yet it contains cocoa.  Indiscernible cocoa, but it is right there on the label.  I find it a bit confusing, since there are actually 5 different illy flavors.  They also offer Cafe<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEZJMA"">illy issimo Caffe Coffee Drink, 6.8-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>, Mochaccino,<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UOA31I"">illy issimo Mochaccino, 8.45-Ounces Cans (Pack of 12)</a> Cafe sugar free,<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I2FGQE"">illy issimo Caffe Coffee Drink, No Sugar, 6.8-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>, latte macchiato, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEZJJI"">illy issimo Latte Macchiato Coffee Drink, 8.45-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>.  I would have expected the mochaccino to have a chocolate flavor, and cappuccino to be strong espresso with milk.<br />So, upon opening the can, I expected a (Starbucks) canned frappuccino-like drink.  Despite the warnings stamped all around the top to not shake the can, I could not stop myself.  No explosion, so not sure what that warning is all about.  The coffee drink inside is a rich brown color, tempered with low fat milk.  Has a certain appeal, although I think it might feel more decadent poured over ice.  And while illy knows its coffee, they did not use enough of it in this prepared drink.  Strong espresso can stand up to the addition of milk, and this was not strong enough.  Had a watered down taste to it, much like home brewed coffee with added milk and sugar.  One thing I dislike about frappuccinos is the texture and somewhat artificial thickness.  illy wins hands down here, because the texture has not been altered.  It definitely feels real.<br />Keeping it under 100 calories is a plus, especially if one plans to drink these regularly.  Large fatty fattening coffees with sugar and cream should be reserved for special treats and given dessert status in our lives.  But you could get away with a 100 calorie drink much more often without sacrificing your health.<br />Overall, the Cappuccino Coffee drink is a pretty average addition to the ready to drink coffee market.  While the ingredients are well thought out (no high fructose corn syrup here!), the proportions left me feeling as though I had enjoyed some average coffee, watered down with milk and a bit of sugar sprinkled over.  Happy it was not any sweeter, just wish it had a richer coffee flavor."
543631,Bay Gibbons,3,"In my opinion, you have to have a taste for this kind of drink. My wife tasted it and really didn't care for it. It definitely wouldn't be my first pick for an energy drink. It reminds me of an energy drink that we had for our football team. So, I would say you can definitely develop a taste for it if your willing to take the time for it. I wouldn't say it gave me a boost but to some it might. I wouldn't waste money on it again. Save the money and buy some  kool-aid."
63524,"Michigoon ""tech geek""",3,"I have to admit that I am not a big fan of coffee, but if it's the right product, I usually love it. Like others who have reviewed this product, I really like the Starbucks bottled frappacinos you can buy in stores, and I figured that I would like this product due to the similarities. This product isn't terrible, but it's not really good either. It had a strong coffee flavor, a little stronger than I like, but there was also a weird aftertaste. I'd have to describe it was sour and bitter, but it wasn't the kind of sour/bitter aftertaste you get sometimes with ""bargain"" coffee brands; it had a unique bad aftertase all its own. I did like the jolt of energy that it had, but I could get the same amount of energy from tastier drinks. It seems like a lot of people like it, so I don't want to put it down entirely, but for me personally, it wasn't something that I enjoyed."

276593,"klopas ""Keith""",3,"I bought this product based on reviews that I read here on Amazon.  Generally, this method for buying products has proven beneficial for me.  However, this go around I was a bit disappointed (not completely though).  I had been looking for a tasty, on-the-go replacement meal for breakfast as I usually do not have time to sit down and eat before I leave the house in the morning.<br /><br />The cookies arrived in their individually wrapped packages, enveloped in a clear plastic wrap with a tie to seal them in.  One morning, I unwrapped one, placed it on a paper plate and heated it up in the microwave for a good 20 seconds.  The cookie came out warm to the touch.  I wrapped it in a few napkins and took it with me to eat while in my car.  The first bite left me feeling duped.  It tasted less like a cookie and more like a slice of whole wheat bread.  I was waiting for the double chocolate chunk (real belgian chocolate) taste to hit my buds, but it never happened.  I did manage to finish eating it and I have eaten over half of the initial twelve in the pack over the last few weeks.  This is because I do not want to waste them - they are healthy - and I will bear with the fact that they do not taste great in my opinion.<br /><br />Sufficed to say, I was disappointed after reading glowing reviews.  However, I would not venture to say that these cookies are disgusting.  They taste wholesome and healthy.  They are filling and do give me a full feeling for around three hours.  For those that are health conscious and are not picky about taste, look no further.  As for me, a person who loves chocolate, I would not purchase another batch of these cookies and will be looking for other breakfast alternatives."
137565,nozama,3,"My family and I were Yuban coffee (Columbian) drinkers for about 25 years+.  We absolutely loved this coffee.  The price was extremely reasonable and it tasted like high-end coffee. However, roughly about 10 years ago, Yuban was sold to Kraft (I think) and they did something to this coffee. The coffee was no longer as smooth as it used to be.  My family and I no longer use this brand. I wish they would go back to whatever it was they were doing RIGHT.  Don't get me wrong; it is not bad coffee but just not what I am used to."
55575,D. Scott,3,"Breakfast cereal manufacturers try to make their products sound healthy and wholesome, but most are made almost entirely from flour and sugar with added vitamins (and, these days, a little fiber).  And that pretty much sums up Kellogg's Crunchy Nut.  Corn meal, sugar, corn bran (sounds like a good idea, but it's not), peanuts, honey, molasses, salt, and oat flour make up the main ingredients (note the three different forms of sugar).<br /><br />A 3/4 cup serving has 100 calories, 1g fat, 23g carbs (10 of which are sugar), and only 2g each of fiber and protein.  With numbers like that, I consider this to be candy or pastry.  It can be regarded as a ""breakfast"" item only in the way that a donut can.<br /><br />Having said that, Crunchy Nut does taste great and has a good crunch (which holds up in milk).  When you first open the bag, you'll smell the roasted peanuts (though they are only very scantly sprinkled over the pieces).  I like sweet things, but this is actually a bit *too* sweet for my taste.  My 10-year-old loved it.<br /><br />In summary, this is a (sadly) typical kid's breakfast cereal.  If this were sold as candy, I'd give it four stars.  But I expect a little bit more nutrition from an item that's sold in the breakfast aisle."
45597,CGScammell,3,"Ginger, lemmon and honey?  That sounds like a decent combination, so I picked this instant mix to try out.<br /><br />When I first opened the packet I smelled lemon and wondered where the ginger was.  But then after sipping this, I quickly learned that the ginger is in the drink!  Soon my mouth and then my lips smacked of ginger, and it got worse with each sip.<br /><br />This is caffeine free, and for people enjoying a hot drink late at night that won't turn them into zombies, this is an option.  The lemon and honey naturally sweeten this drink, but the more you drink this, the more your lips burn.  This may be perfect for that ginger lover in some, but it's definitely a taste sensation that requires getting used to."

Yes, that's clearly stated in the Product Features, but some folks may not see that.  It may not be eatable, for there's something in it that is keeping it from solidifying at room temp as normal coconut oil does - perhaps a chemical.  But as you can see, Amazon is treating it as a 'Grocery' item, and that alone will cause some to order it as a food item.  In my opinion, it should be labeled as a hair oil, and more clearly stated in Amazon's description.<br /><br />Be careful."

433932,Ms Winston,3,"I love cinnamon-flavored cereals, therefore I was quite interested in trying Kellogg's Frosted Mini-Wheats Little Bites Flavored Cinnamon Roll cereal. Frankly, while not a bad cereal, I doubt I would buy it in the supermarket. First of all, the manufacturer was not kidding in naming the cereal ""little bites."" 47 pieces of these tiny mini-wheats constitutes a serving, which did not even begin to fill my cereal bowl. By mid-morning, I was hungry, which normally doesn't happen to me when I eat oatmeal, Wheaties, or Cheerios. I would suggest that a serving of this cereal would be better suited to a mid-morning or late evening snack, or consumed with toast and fruit on the side if served for breakfast. It would also make a good snack for children to take to school. And, second, I not detect a strong flavor of cinnamon, although the smell was nice. When I am going to indulge in a cinnamon flavored cereal, I like a sweeter cereal with a stronger cinnamon taste, such as Cinnamon Toast Crunch.<br /><br />For those who are interested in the nutritional facts, a serving with 1/2 cup of skim milk has 230 calories, and only 1 gram of fat. Although there are 46 grams of carbohydrates in a serving, there are only 12 grams of sugar, which would generally indicate that I should not have become hungry so soon after eating the cereal, so my conclusion is that the skimpy portion was primarily responsible for that. As a contrast, General Mill's Multi-Grain Cheerios, also touted as lightly sweetened, has 150 calories for a one cup serving (with skim milk), 1 gram of fat, 24 grams of carbohydrates and 6 grams of sugar. I find that latter cereal to be filling on its own, which as I indicated was not the case with the Frosted Mini-Wheats Little Bites. My conclusion is that if you are looking for a lightly sweetened cereal, there are better alternatives to the Frosted Mini-Wheats Little Bites."

558185,"Richardson ""Clarence""",3,"So... I seem to have a dry scalp and have settled on two shampoos ...1 is the ever trusty Head & Shoulders 2 in 1 that I get cheap at Costco and when I use too much product on my hair and need a bit of help with an irritated dry scalp or build up... I will use the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree shampoo. The description on this seemed to be a nice combo of the two.... the 2 in 1 (shampoo and conditioner) of the Head & Shoulders along with the tea tree element of the Paul Mitchell. Trouble is it seems to be much closer to the very inexpensive Head & Shoulders and not in the Paul Mitchell ball park for me.  It didn't have the tingle of the Paul Mitchell when using and there is no fragrance attached so it was similar to the bland Head & Shoulders product. The results were also very similar to Head & Shoulders so I think I'd stick with the bargain product and this will not be in my personal ""mix"" of hair care products."

There is no expiration date on the packages but I have the feeling they are old stock. Not chewy and moist but hard and crumbly.

543813,"TammyJo Eckhart ""TammyJo Eckhart""",3,"How can you have something fruit flavored without calories of any type?  In this drink it is because you have a lot of chemicals and vague ""flavors"" that you can add to water and in one squeeze you'll have the equivalent flavor of  fruit punch in this case.  Except that squeeze needs to be a big one to actually make the water taste like fruit punch instead of just water or water with a chemical edge.<br /><br />Normally I only drink water between meals and at meals either 100% fruit juice or skim milk so I'm not expecting a sugary drink.  However when I tried a small squeeze of this additive it made the water taste horrible, a very strong and difficult to describe chemical taste.  It took me several attempts to find an amount, about 5X the simple squeeze, before the water had a positive fruity flavor.  What this means is that one bottle ends up not flavoring nearly as many drinks as it claims.<br /><br />If you really dislike the flavor of water, something I really can't undertand, and using this will get you to drink more, sure give it a try but just know it is unlikely to last as long as the package claims."
244730,Naomi (Storm),3,"I'm a big macadamias lover and generally speaking, Mauna Loa makes some of the best products out there. When I saw that Amazon had the chocolate macadamias on sale, I jumped at the chance to purchase these wonderful treats. Unfortunately these particular chocolate macadamias are covered in so much sweet milk chocolate it all but obliterates the taste of the macadamias. To illustrate, I've uploaded a picture which you should be able to find under the customer images at the top of the item page.  As you can see, the nut is covered with up to a quarter inch of chocolate.  On the plus side the chocolate is pretty good, very similar in flavor to the Hershey's Symphony line - but since that's about all you'll taste, you mine as well go for the Symphony bar with almonds and toffee instead - they're a lot cheaper.<br /><br />While I understand that these may be exactly what some people are searching for when they think ""chocolate covered macadamia,"" I would have preferred a much lighter coating.  Hopefully the picture helps guide some buyers out there so you know what it is you're buying."

129494,Zack Davisson,3,"Twining's can usually be counted on to put out a decent tea.  They aren't really top grade, but nor are they bottom shelf and make for a fine daily bag tea.<br /><br />However, I found their Green Tea to be a bit bland.  Indeed, it is the ""light flavour strength"", as it says on the box, but I wasn't prepared for just how light the flavor would be.  Supposedly, the tea used here is sencha, but I have had many, many cups of sencha and it generally has a bolder, grassier flavor.<br /><br />Because the flavor is so light to begin with, you can't really pull more than one cup out of a bag either.  The next cup is just pretty much colored water, which is disappointing.  A nice strong tea usually yields a few cups, and that saves you some money in the long term.<br /><br />People who don't really enjoy the strong, grassy flavor of green tea might find this a nice balance.  It is easy to make, easy to drink and will probably suit many people.  I was looking for a decent bagged Green Tea to keep at work, but I think I will keep hunting as the flavor was too light for me."

The most aggravating thing, however, is that the product solidifies and you have to let it soak in how water for 5-10 minutes before you can use it EACH time.

Certain flavors (particularly the yellow and green) left a strange flavor lingering in my mouth for a long time after I'd eaten just one of them.<br /><br />The fruit gems themselves did not fit very securely in the packing.  As soon as I removed the outer plastic wrap, I found the box covered in a sticky layer of sugar.  Inside the box, the gems had become all muddled up and were no longer in their set places.  The box was not divided into separate ""spaces"" for each gem, but instead split into two compartments where the gems were all just sort of tossed in together. I was hoping for some better presentation, and if this had been a gift, I would have been quite upset.  Additionally, the ratio of colors seemed somewhat poor:  I got a lot of reds and yellows, but very few yellows and greens, and not a single white one.  Not one!<br /><br />I didn't like these sweets much, because the yellows and greens (as I mentioned) left a particularly odd aftertaste and made my tongue feel weird.  The reds and oranges were not as strongly affected by this weird flavor, and I enjoyed them more.  They were quite irresistible!<br /><br />I'm not sure if I will be buying this product again.  The strange aftertaste was off-putting, and I would have been more disappointed by this product if there had been more greens and yellows in the box. I am glad that I mainly got reds and oranges; but this might not happen next time.  (I really liked the red and orange gems though, and wish I could just buy a box full of only them.) I didn't think that the gems were presented very attractively in their box, and would have definitely preferred that at least the colors be split up more cleanly - this would perhaps help with quality control too, and ensuring an even ratio of each color.<br /><br />I gave the product three stars because I felt it had poor quality control due to not having a very even ratio of flavors.  I, as I say, was glad that I mainly got reds and oranges, but if those are not your favorites, then it might be something of a letdown.  Anyone who loves the white gems would have been horribly disappointed if they had gotten my box - there wasn't a single one in them!<br /><br />I also give it three stars on account of the strange after-taste.  It spoiled things somewhat for me.  I was glad that it was only certain colors that were affected, or else I would not have been able to eat these gems at all.  I found that I was only able to have one of the gems that had an odd flavor, before the after-taste got too much for me."

One pyramid shaped bag makes one rather weak  8 ounce cup of tea. The flavor is good  its just quite mild.
297341,aggiebrewer,3,If you are used to dutched cocoa (or you don't know the difference between cocoa processes) you may want to try a single container before ordering the 12 pack.  The taste of this blend is a little unusual compared to the Hershey's cocoa and other brands I have tried.

16003,Don Wade,3,"I first bought this brand of walnuts at my local store and loved them. They were fresh, crispy and had a hint of spice on them taht made them a tastey snack. I am trying to reduce my cholesterol and walnuts have the correct oils that help with this. So I bought a couple cases of these from Amazon. The nuts I recieved are just as fresh and crispy, but the spices on these containers for some reason are almost overwhelming. There are many nuts in the package that are caked with the mix of garlic, onion paprika, etc..., so much to the point that I have now taken to rinsing them off. This makes them a big soggy.., None the less, they are still a good value compared to the store prices, and you can rinse them , use them in recipes and they take just fine. Wish that they weren't so overpowering, so that I could snack on them right out of the container."
183331,Damian P. Gadal,3,"Just as described.  These are small cookies with a sweet and chewy center.  A tad too sweet for my taste, and there's a bit of an aftertaste, but they do make for a good afternoon snack."

Not a winner in our home, I donated the rest of the bag to a local shelter."

363632,CincyGirl,3,"I had been salivating over these ""steak"" flavored kettle cooked potato chips for a long, long time. I just couldn't see myself paying so much for them...well, finally they were on special, so I bought a case of them. They are good--don't get me wrong--but they don't live up to the description on the package. It's cool that they list the actual variety of potato and where it was grown on the bag--that, I truly dig (no pun intended.) But they don't actually taste of flamegrilled angus steak. They aren't overly salty, and they are good, but nothing special and that's what disappoints me. Know what really gets me? We went to a discount chain last week and bought a big bag of Heinz Ketchup chips and paid two bucks for them--and they are delish! Who woulda thunk it? I did not expect to like them, but the kids wanted them. Now, if you want crunchy, fresh chips, go with these Mackies of Scotland brand chips--they have other flavors and I think maybe they might have been better than the beef ones. I just don't taste beef with these chips here. More like slightly smoky, slightly salty, very crunchy. Not bad, but not worth the extra money, at least for this variety, in my opinion."
338957,Leslie J. Schauer,3,"I have used other brands from [...] and had so much better results. This brand did not even catch a moth for over a week!

I am thinking the hormone is not strong enough or I was sold an older shelf product."

424896,Comdet,3,"Overall this was an OK curry. On the plus side, it's very easy to make - basically cook the beef, then add in the curry mix (2 pouches), simmer and serve.  I added in some vegetables and served it over Jasmine rice.<br /><br />My complaints are that it had more of a sweet taste than I was expecting or cared for. It's a bit oily as well, and could also use a somewhat greater kick with regard to spices. It also had larger pieces of leaves that were not all that appealing.<br /><br />Although I made this with beef, I think it would be as good, and perhaps better, with lamb or pork. The sauce alone is workable over rice and veggies should you prefer not to eat meat.<br /><br />It made for an interesting dish that everyone ate, but I probably would not get this again. I prefer the taste of Indian curries (ideally from scratch, but in a pinch the Taste of India pouches are pretty good)."
117923,fair_jo,3,You can't really expect a 0 calorie product to taste like the real thing but this one does a satisfactory job of satisfying the peanut butter craving.  I've lost 25 lbs and I have used this product regularly as a snack.  I mix 1/2 tablespoon of regular peanut butter to two tablespoons of Walden Farms.  It taste o.k....and cuts the calorie count and cravings...not bad on low carb toast!
284498,JS,3,"These chews are not the same as the ones I get from the vet. Virbac adheres to strict quality control where all the chews are supposed to be the same thickness. I don't know if Amazon gets all the leftovers but the chews in these bags are all different thicknesses. Some are regular size and some are extremely thick. This is a concern for me as my dog had over $2,000 worth of dental work done and I don't want him chewing on anything too thick. These bags are cheaper than the ones I get from the vet and it shows."

77691,Danielle,3,"I was intrigued by this Black Cherry carbonated 100% juice. I have to admit, on my first taste, I hated it. But I took a few more sips, I began to get used to it and like it a bit more. I could definitely taste the cherry in the drink and a hint of apple. Although, I'm not big on carbonated drinks that aren't soda. Also it may have a lot of pluses in what it doesn't put into your drink but if you're watching your calorie intake, The Switch Black Cherry has 130 calories and it's no different than what some soda and juice (like lemonade) have. It always seems slightly strange to me so I probably won't make a permanent switch to The Switch. The price of The Switch is another drawback. To me, $22.99 is a bit much for a 24 pack of 8.3 Ounce cans."
240397,"J. Miller ""Heresy""",3,All three of my dogs absolutely love this food; I really don't understand why but they like it more than much healthier foods I also feed them (maybe it's like doggie junk food.) The ingredients are packed with grains instead of meats and vegetables so it is definitely not the best thing for them; I have taken to mixing this with better food and my dogs now clean their plates (bowls). The food is very affordable and I like the ziplock packaging so it keeps fresh.
152428,Deborah A. Donofrio,3,"I tried cocoa nibs during a recent chocolate tasting I attended so I expected the unsweetened, bitter quality of the nibs (taste). These, however, are a disappointment. The pieces are not consistent in flavor or texture from piece to piece (and the pieces are small). Some pieces have a vinegar-like undertone to the taste while others have the cocoa quality I expect. There seems to be a lot of shell fragments so I will need to re-process the pieces before using them in cookies. While the package says they are recommended for cookies, I wouldn't dare put these into a cookie dough without processing and close inspection. I received 2 shipments (one of which was the nibs) and then found a bug under the boxes so I can't tell where it originated (yuck). I thoroughly examined one package (I purchased 2) and found no critters so I plan to use them even though it means extra work for me. I don't suggest these for bakers."

Granted, she is a picky eater and an elderly cat, but I had hoped she would really enjoy this brand of organic food. I do better to cook and grind my own food for her. Heck, I made baby food when my daughter was a baby what's the difference for an old, sickly kitty cat? As expensive as this brand of cat food is I probably save money making my own. I am disappointed, but when I am a poor, old lady on a fixed income and have to eat cat food so I can buy my meds under Obama-care this is the brand I want to eat!"
310643,Kay,3,"The Graduates entrees are good to experiment with when your little one is first moving on to ""real"" food - you can gauge the size your toddler's appetite and his tastes for instance, and they are reasonably well balanced meals. However, there are more drawbacks than benefits in my personal opinion. There are nine varieties, but some are so similar to each other the selection is actually quite limited. Some (the mac & cheese & the pasta/sauce combos) veer too close to the fast food end of the spectrum for me - if your toddler gets hooked on these early you will have a revolt on your hands when you start trying to feed him meat-and-two-veg type meals. Also they are VERY expensive for what they are. The mac & cheese is the worst; Graduates work out at well over $2 per individual meal, while you could easily make a batch and freeze it in single portions at home for about 15-20c per serving.<br /><br />I found them quite useful as an inspiration to find out what my daughter would eat and how I could cook for her myself; in fact I only ever bought about a half dozen of them and I kept the trays to use for home cooked meals. I imagine it would be useful to keep a few on hand to send to daycare when you don't have time to make lunch yourself, or for the babysitter to have something easy to feed the kids, or even for last-minute trips to Grandma's - but I don't think these alone should be relied on to provide the bulk of a toddler's meals."

I have been fiddling with the exact measurements, thinking that you have to use slightly more then you usually would when making a pot, but be careful not to use too much since it tends to taste ""burned"" or over roasted when you use too much.<br /><br />Also, for some reason, flavored coffee creamer seems to be intensified with this coffee blend so do not use too much.  I know, it sounds weird, but that has been my experience.<br /><br />With the name that Melitta has given this product, I was thinking that it would have had a more dominate flavor.  It just was not that way for me.  Back to my Folgers."

However he is a smart dog and quickly learned how it worked. A scoop of food that used to last him 20+ minutes now only lasted him 10 minutes. Unfortunately after a couple of weeks, the plastic lid that screws onto the jug cracked and it is now useless. This is probably best for pet owners with carpeting since my dog would pick it up and drop it constantly to get the treats out which would be very noisy."

110295,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""",3,"This is clearly a super fancy, super healthy cat treat (it seems almost human level - though the package does expressly remind you that this is only for animal consumption). I have two fat cats who are used to eating dry food and treats with an occasional wet food snack (which they aren't usually that crazy about). One of my cats loved these things and one of them was indifferent, though he did eat it eventually.<br /><br />The phrase ""treats"" might seem a bit misleading considering what the average cat owner thinks of as a ""treat"" but I wasn't thrown off by that. The main issue I had with this item is the packaging. The product consists of three rather large chunks of tuna in a plastic zip lock bag which also has a good deal of liquid in it. Though the package was easy to open, there was a good deal of liquid above the zip lock which means it is easy to get it on your hands or on the counter (and tuna water is not a pleasant smell). Also, the act of getting the treats out of the bag is a little tricky as well (at least for the first one). Again, you just have to plan to get tuna water on your hands and deal with it (not really a big deal).<br /><br />Also, these are pretty big treats (and my cats are 20 pounds each). I ended up giving them one a day (breaking one piece into two) and it was plenty. I found that they liked it more if I mixed it with their usual dry food. Other reviewers have mentioned breaking the tuna apart, which might make it easier to pour a lot out but I kind of liked giving it to them in chunks and they seemed to like it that way too.<br /><br />Overall, the cats ate it up, but I don't think I'd want to spend this much in order to deal with the packaging and liquid issue. Normal treats are fine for my cats, though I commend this company for their environmental policies."
127385,"Tiffany A. Harkleroad ""Tiffanys Bookshelf""",3,"I must have somehow ""missed"" that this was designed for a pod brewing system.  I thought that these were just individual brew bags.  I am not sure exactly what pod brewer these were designed for, but I was pretty sure that these were not going to work in my Keurig, so I decided to go ahead and try to use it as a brewing bag anyway.<br /><br />I filled a microwave safe cup with water, and put the packet in the water.  At this point it is important to note that there are no directions on either the box or each packet.  So, I was pretty much winging it.  I put the cup (with the coffee packet in it) in the microwave for about 3 minutes.  I knew this would make it very hot, so that it could continue to steep/brew as it cooled down.<br /><br />After about five minutes, I took the packed and squeezed the excess water out.  The cup of coffee looked robust, with a dark brown color and a nice smooth scent.  This was my first experience with Yirgacheffe, and while it tasted good, I did not taste any of the berry or floral notes that the description mentions.<br /><br />So all in all, a decent cup of coffee, but there are much better brews out there."

Now it's much more convenient to order from Amazon. I first bought the rice because my grandmother could no longer send me the two or three pounds of native wild rice she gave me each year for holiday meals...so I ordered a pound of Bineshii wild rice.<br /><br />What a surprise! This natural grown wild rice is far superior to the varieties grown on gigantic agribusiness farms in California. It is one of the very best Native American harvested products I've ever tasted. It cooks much more quickly and reliably than agribusiness wild rice, and the taste and texture is very nutty and so delicious. Bineshii wild rice does cost more than mass produced rice, but this is the real thing, and the real thing tastes so much better. My family is spoiled now, they notice if the wild rice isn't Bineshii, and complain if I put anything else on the table! Try a pound, you won't be disappointed."

I don't know how they make these peppermint sticks so soft, but make them they do - and they are mouth-watering. When I first ordered these peppermint stick, I thought they would be hard like all the rest.  Boy was I surprised.  I put that first stick in my mouth and in just a few minutes, it was gone.  Of course I generally break them in half before putting them in my mouth.  That way I can savor them longer.  The last order I placed in June 2012 was for 5 boxes because I had run out of boxes, and I hate to do that - leaving me without my favorite candy.  And to top it off, these peppermint sticks are low in fat.  What a bonus.  Do watch out for the shipping costs because they tend to add up the more boxes you order as these boxes are heavy.  I hope you enjoy these peppermint sticks as much as I do - I am constantly eating them throughout the day.  I guess that is why I go through my boxes so quickly, and they may be high in sugar content, but I haven't gained a single pound from eating these sticks!"

410723,J. Earley,5,"This is one of those, ""now why didn't I think of that?!!"" products.  I thought the pouches were a great improvement but never thought about connecting an actual spoon to the pouch to make it even better.  I'm so glad Boon did!  I came on Amazon to buy another of the Book Squeeze Spoons and saw these.  It's exactly what I wanted and I didn't even know it.  I was squeezing the pouches into the Boon Squeeze Spoon - this removes an entire step and makes things every so easy.  And for people like me who want to use every last drop of the food it ends the frustration of knowing that I'm losing a little on the inside of this and the inside of the container I put the food into.  On the first use I was already developing a technique to get the most out of those pouches while squeezing it into the spoon - I'm a little crazy about stuff like that :)<br /><br />I know people complain about the spoon bowl being a little deeper than most baby spoons but I don't see it as a problem at all. When my babies are little they don't clean the spoon on the first pass, I either turn and tilt the spoon so they can get the last bit or forget about it and squirt more in.  It's not a big deal.  When they get older they'll clean it out just fine.  It's the same size as the Boon Squeeze Spoon so we're already used to it.<br /><br />The only concern I had was that these would get lost down the garbage disposer when tossed into the sink.  I solved that by putting in one of those mesh strainers that covers the drain.  All in all it's a great product!"

With the current fear of rice shortage, we suggest you get yourself a bag of this rice now.<br /><br />Royal Basmati Rice brings eating rice to a new level.  I first learned about it a few years ago in New Orleans at a combination Middle Eastern restaurant/grocery.  The owner there had not heard someone from Mississipi talk before, and he kept following me around the store because he was fascinated with my accent.  He asked me if I was from Scotland.  He sold me my first bag of Royal Basmati. ""This is what we use to feed our customers,"" he said.  I had no idea that rice could taste that good.<br /><br />Here is the way the Royal people recommend you cook it:<br />Cooking Instructions for Stovetop<br /><br />1 cup of uncooked Royal Basmati Rice yields 3 cups cooked Rice.<br /><br />Measure: 1 cup of rice, 1 ½ cups of water, 1 tablespoon of oil, butter or margarine, a pinch of salt.<br /><br />1. Rinse measured rice 1 to 2 times or until water is clear to remove extra starch and drain.<br />2. Place the drained rice into the saucepan and add measured water, oil and salt.<br />3. Place saucepan (uncovered) over high heat and bring to boil, stir occasionally.<br />4. Let water reduce slightly below the rice level and the lower the heat to the minimum.<br />5. Place a tight lid on the saucepan and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes.<br /><br />Herre is the way we cook it:<br />We don't wash it.  We simply place 1 cup of Basmati rice and 2 cups water in a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009W7E8K"">Calphalon Tri-Ply Stainless-Steel 8-Quart Stockpot with Glass Lid</a>.  We bring it to a boil and cook it at medium heat until the water is absorbed.  That's all.<br /><br />The rice is supposed to last two years if kept under 70 degrees.  It can be refrigerated.  We simply keep it on the shelf without a problem.<br /><br />Cooked rice can be kept in the refrigerator for six days or frozen up to six months. To reheat just add 2 tablespoons of liquid, cover and heat for about 5 minutes on top of the stove or 1 minute on HIGH in the microwave. Fluff with a fork.<br /><br />You can freeze  Basmati rice before or after cooking. Store it in an airtight container to prevent frost from forming on it<br /><br />Here is a dish using Basmati from Flavored with Love: Mary Lou's Family and Friends Can Cook:<br />SHRIMP CURRY<br />2 pounds medium raw shrimp, peeled and deveined (Country girls don't devein their shrimp.)<br />2 tablespoons peanut oil (or canola oil if peanuts are a problem)<br />3 large garlic cloves, minced<br />½ cup green onion, diced<br />½ cup pea pods, strings removed<br />4 cups assorted oriental vegetables, chopped into large pieces Juice of 1 lime<br />3 blocks Golden Curry Sauce Mix® (mild or for Louisiana tastes,  medium hot)<br />2 tablespoons chicken broth<br />½ cup unsalted cashews<br />1 cup uncooked rice (Basmati is excellent with shrimp curry.)<br /><br />Prepare the rice according to the package instructions.

314730,D. Blankenship,5,"Cheerios are the first breakfast cereal I can remember eating.  Other than Grapenuts, it is the only one I still eat.  As my memory of these go back to just after the war (WWII) that is a lot of Cheerios over the years.  This is one of the few products that I know of that they have not messed around with and as far as I can tell, they taste the same to day as they did when I had my first bowl.<br /><br />These things are cholesterol free with no saturated fats.  There are no added colorings or flavor.  They are just about perfect as such things go.  In addition to being a breakfast staple, they are also almost always my ""going to bed snack""...a habit I have had for years.<br /><br />These are also one of my favorite munching foods.  When reading I normally have a box next to my reading chair which to be honest, beats the heck out of pork rinds, potato chips or Moon Pies. The dogs seem to enjoy them as much as I do.  I also do a lot of traveling via automobile and I always have a box or two of these with me to eat right out of the box.  They tend to keep me from turning into every fast food place I encounter and they are great for keeping you awake during long trips, in particular at night.<br /><br />These are a wonderful and traditional cereal and I do hope they stay around for a long, long time.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks"

294729,"Wolfsatz Domain ""Wolfdorf""",5,I've tried all three new 'Dark' offerings from Gevalia and I think this is the best one from the three. Gevalia finally came up with coffee worth serving to your guests.<br />Coffee has an earthy bold taste with little to none bitterness and no metallic after taste; it actually leaves a nice smooth tasty chocolaty after taste.<br /><br />The pack comes with 12 big T-discs that will brew 8 ounces of coffee. This coffee will delight those who love the darker roasts.<br /><br />Update:<br />I am on my 5th cup of this coffee and it was really grown on me (changing from a 4 to 5 stars); it is quite tasty and smooth. This is one coffee that will truly satisfy the void that Sbux left. There will be some that will say that this is not the same as Sbux and it isn't! Try the coffee and give it a fair taste without trying to compare it to anything else you may find yourself quite surprised at the findings. Highly recommended and definitely will be buying this one again.

(To be precise, you would mix about half as you normally would).<br /><br />However, even know it is robust, it still contains less caffeine then normal coffee. By the way, chicory is extremely healthy for you.<br /><br />Try it today, taste what New Orleans has had for well over 140 + years."

Also low in sugar with no artificial sweeteners. The added bonus is that all of this is packaged in recycled material. This is a product and company that one can easily support."

210659,Audi Quattro,5,"I have always been Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee beans lover over the past 12 years.  I have tried alternative beans and blends over the years from starbucks, DD.., and whatever local store sells..  Just can't find anything better than these JBM coffee.  On top of that, the JBM blends we used to get locally was no longer available.  I have tried many online JBM beans and they weren't really make me thirst for more.<br />We decided to shop online again and I have done my home work and narrow down to few in to my To-Try list.<br />This is the first one I gave it a try from Organic Camno Island coffee roasters.  Based on these reviewers,  I thought it looks promising and they were right.<br />It is really good coffee for the money.  Sure it ain't  $6/lb but it is not $45/lb JBM beans either.<br />We use your typical MR coffee machines... it is not we can't use a better machine,  rather, a good coffee would taste good even from the simplist standard coffee brewing machines.  It is really coming down to freshness of the beans and amount of water added.  It is not always true that hotter water temp makes brewing taste better.  That is from my personal experience tasting from these $15 machines vs the fancy starbucks machines and other industrial grade capaccino machines.  It is hard to judge reviewers brewing method as everyone do it different way as well.<br /><br />I am a black coffee drinker with no sugar or milk and cream added.  A good coffee to me would taste better without other additives added to enhance the flavor.<br /><br />Ok,  now, how does this bean taste when I brew it to my liking?<br /><br />Dark and rich and not acidic at all.<br />A hint of cocoa/vanilla with light sweetness from the beans itself.  It is definitely a treat.  This is definitely a worthy coffee to try.<br />It is on my subscription list now."

80908,"dalepres ""dalepres""",5,"I have been eating these pepperonis for 15 years.  I have had two go bad in storage but that is not Bridgford's fault.  They store for a year or more at room temperature if you keep them in a cool room but if one gets a puncture in the wrapper or exposed to too much heat, etc., then all bets are off.  If the wrapper is still vacuum tight and the expiration date has not passed, then it should be fine.  If the wrapper is loose at all or the product has expired then, yes, you might have one that is bad.  If it is as bad as some here describe then it is my guess they are eating spoiled food.  Not smart.  But in 15 years of eating these, I have only thrown out two for spoilage and that is after having stored them for quite a while.<br /><br />These do have more fat (and more flavor) than bagged pepperoni.  They do make great pizza but you will have a hard time slicing them as thin and even as some big factory - so just don't expect the exact look, feel, and taste.  These are still delicious in their own right.<br /><br />I have to laugh about reviews from folks who eat seemingly spoiled food and then say that anyone who likes this must work for Bridgford. No, I do not work for Bridgford.  I just eat their products."

Its not hot at all in my opinion but it does have that bite that lingers nicely after consumption [not overbearing]. I can see why others have commented that this and the other non pure version were considered great flavor enhancers.<br /><br />I am a little disappointed as far as the heat level is concerned. I was hoping to experience more of the bhut jolokia, but over all I am very happy with experimenting with this brand. Mad Dog you have 1 more fan to add to your list of many.

We have been pleased enough with the quality that I won't hesitate to order another after he chews his way through this.  I have a larger Swiss Mountain Dog who chewed through a medium one of these in 3-4 days, but this monster size still has him going two weeks later.  I must note that just about any normal dog would be busy for the better part of a year with an antler like this so when longevity is factored into the cost equation, $18 makes a whole lot more sense.<br /><br />For anyone needing a natural, EXTREMELY durable treat for their beast to chew, antlers are the only way to go.  We have tried yak treats, beef bones, nylabones, and everything else we could find online or in both mainstream and specialty pet stores.  Antlers and silicone toys are the only thing I will buy him anymore because he destroys $35 ""indestructible"" toys in under an hour (lesser toys die a quicker, more violent death)."
87694,"S. ""strap""",5,"Hans Riegel was not only one of the most prominent manufacturer's of sweets, he introduced a product to the world that's far more addictive than crack or heroine.  These sweet little gummies are some of the tastiest bits of candy on the market.  Unfortunately they're addictive as well...my son foams at the mouth, begging for gummies at all hours.  At times this works to our advantage...bribery, a la the Scooby Snack. However, we know these are not the most nutritious snacks on the market.<br /><br />Curse you Hans Riegel!"

106002,Krispy,5,"The product is great and I got it as an impulse item when purchasing a book.<br />It was delivered separately and the shipping charge was $10 on a 3.99 item. I can get this at a local store but ordered it as a convenience. I learned my lesson! Don't remember being told it would be that much to ship, would have been nice to know beforehand."
268349,J. Moore,5,"What do I like about this product? Truth in advertising....It's crunchy -  and stays crunchy in milk. It has a clear vanilla flavor - pure, not artificial tasting. It is healthy and compares well with other similar products in terms of sugar, fiber and general nutrition guidelines. It tastes great and I found myself eating it for breakfast and later on as a inter meal snack. Recommended!"
279479,Snowbabe,5,"We have been eating I.M. Healthy soynut butter for almost 9 years now since my oldest son found out he had peanut allergies and I love it.  I love peanut butter also and was so happy to find something similar to give my son.  It's great by itself, in sandwiches, on apples, carrots and even baked in cookies.  It's not exactly the same taste as peanut butter, but it is just plain good in it's own right.  We love it.  You've got to give it a try if allergies are an issue for anyone in your family."
33713,Bruja Juera,5,"Pirate's Booty has been my 16 month old daughter's favorite snack since she was 6 months old. Great for babies who are just starting on solids because it dissolves easily in their mouth, it's gluten-free, low in sodium (has less sodium than cheerios) and it just plain tastes good. I usually throw some Pirate's Booty in a snack saver cup and carry it in my diaper bag when I'm out running errands. Whenever my daughter starts to lose her patience, I pull it out and Viola!! I've got a happy baby again. I swear, this stuff is magic!! Don't know how I would have gotten through this past year (or gotten anything done) without it!! : )<br /><br />At our local grocery store, a 4 oz bag usually sells for $2.99. Buying it by the case using Amazon's Subscribe and Save program, it comes out to $1.78 bag. That's a pretty good deal in my book, especially considering how much of this stuff my daughter can go through."

130015,Kiwi,5,"This is a delicious snack and the whole grains are much better than the white puffed rice I enjoyed as a kid. It's yummy, it's nutritious, it fills your belly and it's inexpensive. I even put a little bit in my dogs food and they think it's a great treat !! I used to eat this all the time when I was a kid, and I just recently started buying it for the family again. My mother used to melt some butter, add puffed rice and heat it up in the pan. It's fantastic !!"

206120,M. Wagner,5,We have been ordering this coffee directly from Community for some time now as we will not drink anything else.  The shipping charges are fairly high to order direct so we were very excited to find it being sold on Amazon!  Excellent price and great value!
72735,"Julie A. Smith ""Julie @ Knitting and Sundries""",5,"These were purchased with Subscribe and Save for my college student.  Better than Ramen noodles for a dorm resident who only has a microwave, my daughter says that these come in handy when she's in the midst of a study session and doesn't want to leave the dorm to pick up food and that they also taste great!  She also says they're huge, which I can verify, since I saw them on my last college visit.  Very good buy and I will definitely keep my Subscribe and Save going for these."
469467,L Martin,5,"Since we're not into herbal teas, it was a challenge to find a decaf tea that the whole family loves. This one is it. Strong lemon flavor. Added benefit of vitamin C. Good anytime, but particularly in cold and flu season. Only available in sample packs in the grocery stores in our area, so we order regularly from Amazon."

361613,LOVE TO LEARN,5,"I am very picky about salad dressing.  It is few and far between that I find a dressing that I like.  I must say I could eat this dressing by itself! It is that good.  In the past I have resorted to making my own dressing, as I am that picky.  Another plus is this dressing has no sugar in it.  Buying this at the store is EXPENSIVE!!!  My store sells it for $5+ a botte, so finding it here at this price was awesome."

I didn't see them myself since she lives out of state, but she thought they were very expensive. And she said they tasted great.<br /><br />One note, my mom just assumed it was from me. I did mark it as a gift, and they didn't include the price on the box. So that was good, but it didn't have my name on it anywhere and they don't give you the option to write a little note.<br /><br />They gave me a 5 day window for delivery. It got there 2 days earlier than the last day on the window, which happened to be exactly on her birthday. So I was very happy."
520265,"Diogenes ""Auricle""",5,"Of all of the ready mixed Indian spices, sauces and pastes I find this the most agreeable. I use it as a marinade and grilling sauce for chicken tikka in a recipe that they once had on the bottles but seems to have vanished.<br /><br />4 tbs.  Tikka Paste<br />1 tbs.  Hot curry paste<br />1/4 cup  yoghurt (I prefer to use Greek yoghurt)<br /><br />Mix thoroughly and marinade the chicken for about 6 1/2 hours. Grill in the oven at 400 degrees for 22 - 25 minutes (depending on the size of the bits)<br /><br />A Tandoor is much hotter, but that temperature gives you time to have a starter and still seals in moisture.<br /><br />Serve with raw onion and Naan or Roti."
229484,Beverly,5,"The bags are a perfice size for small children as well as adults.  Your hand fits in perfectly and holds enough popcorn.  At first I though that the 1000 bags that you receive was rediculous.  However, they dont take up a lot of storeage space and if you eat popcorn they way we do, it's worth it.  Smaller quantites were actually more expensive."
412541,microjoe,5,"I like ""Vernor's"", and drink it all the time. It is old fashioned drink from Michigan, since 1866, and the labeling was known for its lovely green and gold colors and the gnome character. If you look at the can it is actually called ginger soda instead of ale and is different than typical ginger ale in taste. Vernor's has a strong vanilla presence, is smoother and more moist, and sweeter than a ginger ale. It is closer to a cream soda than ginger ale, very good. A ginger ale is more dry, higher in carbonation, and has a spicier bite to it. Vernor's has 39 grams sugar in the full size can, versus 33 grams per can for Schweppes Ginger Ale. Neither has caffeine.<br /><br />The recipe has changed a bit over the years mostly in the choice of sweeteners. They use the same high fructose corn syrup that the cost-cutting mega soda companies use, rather than the cane sugar they used to use. The down side to that is that the corn syrup syrup drowns out some of the flavors. Many microbrews are using cane sugar again, although it costs more, to get a better taste. Vernor's is still aged in oak barrels for 3 years, no doubt accounting for the smoothness. All in all a great soda for anytime. The soda is also known, like other ginger drinks, for its use as a home remedy for an upset stomach.<br />Vernor's is a regional soda, and there are many areas of the country you can't find it in. That is why it sells here. They may be selling it in glass bottles again soon, at least there is a page that says so the day I am writing this comment. Search at Amazon for ASIN: B001JK2SEG to see what I mean. Vernor's has quite a history, and there are two books at Amazon about the soda. The first is Vernor's Ginger Ale (Images of America: Michigan) ISBN-10: 0738551856. The second book is ""The Vernor's Story: From Gnomes to Now"" ISBN-10: 0472066978 a book about the company's marketing green and gold packaging with the famous gnome, and Vernor's fans."

103114,Choosey Shopper,5,I love all the Torani sugar-free syrups I have tried.  I use them in my coffee (hot or iced) nearly every morning.  I frequently mix the Chocolate sugar-free syrup and the hazelnut sugar-free syrup in my coffee for a custom flavor.  The price and selection are the best at Amazon.
56900,Thunder,5,"This dill weed came in a heat sealed metallic plastic bag. When I cut it open and took a whiff, the aroma was heavenly. Wow. I poured it out into several plastic spice containers to find that it has a deep green color, is fresh, not old or faded in color or aroma. There were no cut up stems or filler of any kind.<br /><br />I use dill weed in so many things, from baking to cooking to popcorn topping. This dill is, hands down, the best I've ever purchased. It's even better than when I've bought dill weed fresh at the store and dried it myself. The flavor is bold and rich and delicious.<br /><br />This 16 oz bag is a fraction of the cost that I'd pay at the grocery store, where a 2 oz bottle is $5.99. This is an economical way to buy dill weed.<br /><br />Excellent quality. I will definitely purchase this again when I run out."
14818,Leonard Baker,5,"These are very good chocolate covered craberries and a great value for the money spent, especially if you have a Prime membership, which I treated myself to recently.  They got here in 2 days, taste great, and you more than get your monies worth.  My Mom and brother love their bags too, so they could make great gifts as well."
273601,Jared K. Myers,5,"Short and sweet, if you like salt and vinegar chips, you should definitely give these a taste.  The only bad thing about these is it's nearly impossible to stop eating them."
347055,Wingnut NYC,5,"Who'd have thought plain freeze-dried chicken would be so irresistible to cats? I also call this stuff 'Kitty Krack' - all my six cats love it.<br /><br />The healthful part is also a very big concern for me since one of my cats is diabetic. Halo's is one of the very few treats around that's low carb enough that I can give them as a reward for him cooperating with blood testing. It works great. The diabetic guy heads right to his testing spot on the sofa as soon as I get the jar of Liv-a-Littles out of the fridge and give it a shake. The other kitties follow us and wait for their share of the treat action.<br /><br />It's not cheap, but I give them each a small chunk and a little extra for the one getting blood-tested, and a jar usually lasts for five days or so. Well worth it."
339310,Jim,5,"It was maybe 6 months ago that I discovered that WalMart's generic version of Crystal Light water-flavoring mixes (marketed under the Great Value brand) included a Lime Margarita flavor. I tried it and liked it and have been drinking it ever since. But now that I've tried Crystal Light's Margarita mix, I won't go back to Great Value Lime Margarita, even though it is typically the case that Crystal Light mixes are more expensive than the generic versions.<br /><br />They do not taste the same, but then neither do all alcohol-based margaritas. (Crystal Light Margarita is of course meant to be mixed with water.) The Crystal Light Margarita is less tart than Great Value Lime Margarita - less of an acidic taste and aftertaste - and tastes better to me overall. Crystal Light Margarita contains sodium - 30 mg. per an 8 oz. powder-mixed-with-water serving - compared to 10 mg. per serving of the Great Value Lime Margarita mix. (A typical low-sodium diet limits one to 1500 milligrams of sodium daily.)<br /><br />Although Crystal Light Margarita does not taste like a ""real"" margarita (including Skinny Girl Margarita, which I have tasted), and although I cannot imagine using it as a mix for preparing ""real"" margaritas, I wouldn't hesitate to serve it - perhaps even with a bit of salt on the rim and a wedge of lime - with Mexican cuisine. It's got a flavor that I think would go well with such cuisine (I tried it over ice as an accompaniment to chips, salsa, and guacamole, and found that it complemented these nicely)."
512599,Gryffindor Girl,5,"Tried these one day when I was starving at work and needed a snack, a coworker gave me one. I was impressed with how yummy and natural they are. I immediately wanted more, so I found them on here and now get a box delivered monthly. I use them as a healthy snack at work, at home, or when I'm out cycling. At the auto-deliver price, they work out to around $.80 per bar or so, which I think is very reasonable. I'm happy to have a ""good fat"" snack in the house for us to eat, instead of resorting to chips, candy bars, etc. I did counsel my family that they can only have one per day, as while they're good fat, they should still be eaten in moderation. :) Anyways - they're delicious!

It seems my local pet and grocery stores can't keep it in stock, so I just order it every month through Amazon.  This product doesn't try to mask catbox odors with equally bad floral odors.  Instead, the real green tea used in this product seems to absorb the bad odors, leaving no odor at all.  What a relief."

Keep a cold drink nearby when you eat this salsa!!"

We were anticipating a very ""sweet"" treat, which we don't care for. Instead the cookie had a robust semi-sweet taste. I attribute that to the chocolate used. It taste almost like baker's chocolate. Recommended if you have a desire for something sweet but not overpowering."

323913,D. C. Tussing,5,"After first experiencing this tea from across a table in NYC, I had to taste it myself.  The aroma starts the relaxation process before the first sip.  I am NOT a green tea drinker in general, as I find them to be somewhat tasteless.  But this tea relaxes and refreshes with it's subtle mint and lemon flavor.  If you don't experience the flavor, you aren't steeping the bag long enough.  I find it to be the perfect every night tea just before bed.  I only wish I could purchase it in larger quantity."

143959,"DonGiovanna ""Viva il Maestro""",5,"I usually don't write food reviews because, well, 'one man's meat is another man's poison', as the saying goes. We actually stumbled upon these cookies. On a whim, I picked up a package marked for clearance at Target and, since then, my daughter and I have been fighting over it. Unfortunately, I can no longer find them at Target so I guess we will now have to buy in packs of 6 through Amazon. Never mind, I suppose I can store them in the cool basement.<br /><br />We try to not eat too many in a day as 2 cookies will cost you 130 calories (so this pretty much means eating only 2 cookies per day!). I am very sensitive to food additives and can always detect the chemicals in some 'natural' foods (e.g. Kashi). One bite and I could tell that there are none in these cookies. Also important was that it is just gently sweet; most off-the-shelf cookies are much too sweet for me. Think I'm also going to try Back to Nature's Graham Cookies through Amazon since it's got some rave reviews! I'm definitely sold on this brand."

I had a terrible cold/flu recently, and my throat was so sore.  This soothed my sore throat every time!  Love it!  It's definitely a keeper, and it's priced much better than the fancy boxes I find in the high-end grocery stores around here, which is the only way I can find African Honeybush tea here."

241233,"barbie ""doggy mom""",5,My dogs loved these and they are good for them as well. They didnt cause loose stools like most treats (thank you for adding the pumpkin!) They are an excellent product and are very affordable as well.
118958,"ferrethouse ""ferrethouse""",5,My dogs love these treats & my cats will follow me around the house when I'm holding an open bag of them.  Probably due to the very fishy smell.  The treats are square shaped & a bit bigger then the size of a quarter.
284127,Leslie Ann Lewis,5,"I make my daughter's baby food because my previous experience with store-bought foods (granted it was many years ago) was that they were overly processed, foul tasting, and inconvenient.  The food never tasted anything like what the label proclaimed it to be and usually tasted rather flavorless or sour, and they were only available in clunky containers that were annoying to pack or store.  This looked different so I decided to give it a try and I am glad that I did.<br /><br />First, and most important to me, the food is made of all natural and organic ingredients.  Second, I can clearly taste the vegetables and fruit in each bite, and I can identify them as greens and pear.  Third, the storage container is extremely convenient.  I don't have to worry about the package breaking open in her bag and it is easy to serve her exactly the amount I desire.<br /><br />The packaging recommends that the product be consumed within 24 hours and in my house that is no problem. My sometimes-reluctant-to-eat 6 month old had absolutely no difficulty polishing off a container in a day.  And if she did, it tastes so good that I would probably not mind finishing it off.  She loves the taste and the consistency is great for someone just starting on purees."
233072,Shaun,5,"Googled ""best hot/chili sauce in the US"" the other day and Huy Fong Sriracha popped up. I read that this brand is one of the best hot chili sauce so I figured I would give it a try. I was hoping that a supermarket near my apartment would sell this brand, and to my delight it does.<br />I understand now why this is one of the best hot chili sauce out there. man! its so spicy and hot that I must have drinking water near me all the time I'm eating this sauce. Not only I like the spiciness, it has a little garlic taste to it too. Plus the squeeze bottle is a plus. I'm never gonna buy different brands again. This will do."
265382,J. Acree,5,"Works great in coffee and tea, and can be used in baking as well."
527379,S. D. Thomas,5,"I have bought this Planter's mix several times and love the blend of sweet and salty crunch.  The nuts are big and whole, and the chocolate covered soybeans are just enough to satisfy a sweet craving.  I use this mix as a snack for myself - a great source of protein, too."
367721,Eff,5,"I use this primarily to prevent diaper rash on my son. We use cloth diapers and coconut oil is safe on them. Since buying the jar, I've used it to treat mild sunburns, cracked nipples, chapped lips, dry elbows, cradle cap... there isn't much coconut oil cannot moisturize!"
530004,Lori B.,5,"This is one of my favorite cereals and I thought it wasn't being made anymore because my usual store was not carrying it anymore.  But now I can buy it at a cheaper price and have it delivered by Amazon.  The cereal is high in fiber, low fat and very crunchy.  It stays crunchy in milk and has a lot more texture than something like bran flakes or Total.  It is useful when I'm dieting but I still eat it when I'm not.  I don't get tired of it and it really fills me up."
265386,"Mom in Maryland ""Mom in Maryland""",5,"I've been using Agave in my tea, coffee, cooking and on pancakes for over a year. I'm a type 2 diabetic, and need something with a low glycemic index.  This product is the best - and it tastes wonderful.  My kids don't miss honey on their pancakes any more, and this keeps everyone from having sugar highs and crashes.<br /><br />Highly recommend!"
317730,Alfred,5,"The product is great!!  The price was even greater.  I used the Cider Cups at work, had to have some, searched on line, and as usual, found the best price through Amazon.  Thanks."
369642,carcalifornia,5,"definitely a great snack! these goji berries have an AMAZING taste!!<br />i used to buy chocolate covered raisins but i've found that this brand was making dark chocolate goji berries, which is much healthier. i love it!"
227022,Chee-waa-waa,5,"Health Warrior Chia Bars Acai Berry.  I purchased these as a late afternoon healthy snack.  I also purchased some other Chia items from other companies (Fruitchia) - yuck.  These wer MUCH better.  While only 100 calories, they tasted like eating something indulgent, like a cookie.  I liked the taste, tecture, and content. They were slightly smaller than I expected, but the taste was outstanding.  I am a little worried to see that they are suddenly not available - what's up?  I want more!"
261820,Yankee Fan,5,These were typical Hershey kisses and were delivered quickly and in a carton that contained cold packs to preserve the product. Would order again (and  may) except my wife feels that if they are around the house she will be tempted to eat them and she doesn't want to be tempted.
59251,Abbomatic,5,"This is my favorite daily tea. And while this is a huge bag, I use a ""pretty tin"" that I never wanted to get rid of for 3 weeks of tea close to the kettle. This is an GREAT buy! Enjoy, and relax with a great black tea!"
3694,chibbi,5,My daughter loves these snacks and so does everyone else. I try to feed my daughter organic stuff and I'm so glad that Earth's Best makes a variety of snacks that she can have.
524204,Brad Willis,5,"Nabisco SnackWell Fudge Drizzled Caramel Popcorn is very tasty.  You'd have no idea that this was a ""light"" or ""diet"" snack, but it is indeed low in calories and relatively low in fat.<br /><br />This caramel popcorn is moist and has more fudge drizzled on it than you'd think.  I think they're extremely tasty.  I suppose my only complaint would be that each serving is just a bit over 1 ounce.  So it's a very tasty snack but you don't get a lot of it.  I could eat an entire box in 1 or 2 sittings withough any trouble.<br /><br />However, if you are looking for a reasonably healthy and very tasty snack that comes in controlled portion servings, this is a good choice."
206704,Elie Murphy,5,"Stephen's Gourmet Hot Cocoa, Pumpkin Spice, is easy to fix and has a wonderful creamy taste.  It's a great flavor change from their special ""flavored cocoa mixes"" that I love also.  I often relax with a cup of ""Pumpkin Spice"" as a late afternoon reward for a day well spent.<br /><br />I buy a variety of the Stephen's Gourmet Hot Cocoa mix flavors in the bulk Packs of 6 and really appreciate the Subscription option for the reduced price per can. I enjoy them every morning, mixed to my taste with instant coffee for a rich, flavorful mocha."
212331,El Pato,5,My wife & I enjoy eating at San Sai where we discovered this soy sauce.  Now we can enjoy it at home too.  Quick Shipping.
562644,Marilyn Graper,5,I love this coffee!  And such a great price.  Will buy more when I am running out which will be soon.
58110,Arlene,5,"I wanted to try the Miracle Noodles after seeing them on the Dr. Oz show.  I looked for them in health food stores and went to some major grocery stores, no one sold them.  I found them on Amazon and took a chance and purchased a 24 pack.  I was a little concerned about all the reviews that said they had a fish smell and taste.  Also I was concerned about the texture, having read that they are rubbery. When they arrived I was surprised that the packages are so small. One pack will satisfy one person if it is meant as the main dish, however as a side it will be alright for two people.  I found that if you follow the directions on the package(which I did) there is no fishy taste or smell.  The product gets its flavor from the sauce you put on it.  As for the texture it is definitlty different.  It is a little rubbery and difficult to eat or seperate into servings unless I cut them into smaller sizes first.  It does fill you up as it is soluable fiber, it has no other nutritional benefits.  However I will continue to use this product as it is a great way to get additional fiber into the diet.  Also once you get use to the texture it is nice to be able to eat a bowl full with no worries about calories, fat, or cholesterol.  I just put a little spaghetti sauce on it."
271329,"Shelly Marshall ""Day By Day""",5,"Remember the old creamers when you were a kid? (only baby boomers will remember this). We used to eat the powered creamer by the spoon becasue it was so good. And then researchers mistakenly said that ""dairy"" was bad for the heart and everything went to chemicals? The new chemical creamers are yucky--but if you want to return to the good old days--this is it!!!"
516974,Emily,5,"I really enjoy oolong, not only for the taste, but also for the benefits-- I am not a fan of green tea, but want all the goodies! I have tried many brands of oolong, mostly ""natural, organic"" and thus, rather expensive. I thought I would try this, based on the good reviews, and I love it! I find it actually less bitter than many alternatives. This will be my standard oolong from now on!"
484539,"TheraP ""TheraP""",5,"This is a wonderful tea.  But yes, it's expensive.  I wish it came by the pound, so I could afford it daily."
372023,"J. Geary ""LA Lady""",5,"This is great full flavored gunpowder, be sure to follow the brewing directions - oversteeping should never be permitted. Well worth the price for organic tea - love it."
334917,shea,5,"I thought all stevia packets were the same, pure stevia. I was wrong. A lot of the packets out there are natural stevia but also have added chemicals. But i've have been using sweet leaf for a while now and I am very happy. It is pure stevia. No added anything. Very happy with their product."
430135,colorado84,5,Our whole family loves these crackers (especially good with hummus).  We have a subscription to purchase them every two months as it becomes far cheaper to buy them this way.  Highly recommend!
259659,Drew,5,Love the price and the number of boxes you get. 4 boxes for around $5-6 is bargain price. Stores usually jack up the price of Cap'n because it's a brand name so it's nice to see Amazon offer an alternative.
300280,L. A. Vitale,5,I just bought my 1st box of this tea yesterday and I am now hooked on this tea!! I love the strawberry flavor. It is subtle without being overpowering and it has a smooth vanilla/buttery after taste. I love this product. It is organic too.
129679,C. Smith,5,I think these chips are wonderful. I read that some people don't like the hard crunchy chips inside. (Yucca's) I'm just the opposite I guess. I couldn't love the hard crunchy bit's more. Their wonderful. I could do without the really soft stuff. I guess it's totally up to you to get them and try. I definitely would recommend these. I'd also buy these yucca chips in a bag all there own. That's how much I like them:)
297353,"Jenifer R. Luce ""jluce""",5,This is the best cocoa that I have ever used!  The chocolate flavor is much richer than Hershey's or Nestle's.  You can even see the difference in the color of the cocoa...much deeper brown color.  My brownies with chocolate icing are better than ever after trying this brand!
113112,Mark Ulm,5,It's great for making popcorn in my Stir Crazy popper.<br />We bought it because it's suppose to be really good for you.<br />I'll let you know in 50 years if it made me live longer.
259662,"K. Quinn ""Author of the Ice Moon series""",5,"I'm 12 weeks pregnant with my 6th child and have been plagued with all day sickness for 7 weeks. Once 8pm would hit, the severest nausea would strike, getting worse until around 3:30am. My sweet hubby bought this tea for me along with a bunch of other hopeful remedies for the hellish stomach upset I was feeling. Skeptical, I decided to give the tea a try and boy was a I glad I did. I would sip the warm tea slowly and much to my surprise it helped!!! My nausea would get so bad I didn't want anything in my stomach including liquid, but sipping this tea slowly seemed to ease the upset. It's a really comforting tea and I'm so thankful I had it!"
44770,"R&B Johnsonite Rockford Williamson ""Star Review""",5,Use these almonds everyday as a snack. Leave them at home and measure 1/4 cup of nuts out for a snack to take to work with you during the day. Do not keep them on your desk because you wont stop eating them!!
512546,"Veronica Winters ""VeronicasArt""",5,This product is great. I love baking with poppy seeds and I think the price is not so ovewhelming as buying a tiny can in any store. This product arrived fresh and tasty.
52969,Bashert,5,"They are so wide and delicious with a simple drunken noodle recipe that you can find at ""A Taste of Thai"" website.  Also if you love Phad Thai, you'll like these wide noodles with it too, whether you make form scratch or use ready made Phad Thai seasonings.  Hey, if you like rice, rice noodles, and pasta dishes you'll love these; glad I got a whole case of 6. We use only half a box at a time so it's a great purchase!"
193200,T. Sykes,5,"This is an excellent product.  If you are on the Belly Fat Cure and have plans to make the Old Fashioned Pancakes, this syrup will totally amaze you.  It's thick and very much so tastes like Aunt Jemima or any of the other ""pancake syrups"".  I still love real maple syrup better but can't handle the sugar grams so I'll be very happy with this for now."
440363,Cathio,5,"My son loves these and says they are the best hot fries. They are a little hot for me but I love the cheese ones. We just ordered those too and I ate a bag already...uh-oh! Will order again with Prime and also on subscribe and save..to save money.<br /><br />As a side note, we just realized we can get free movie streaming having Prime membership on Amazon with our Roku and Netflix 9.00 a month subscription.  Saves LOTS of money on movies. Yeah!"
38296,"Laura L. Hubka ""Lhubka""",5,"I have been using ZipFizz for about 6 months now and I love it.  I am partial to the Grape and Orange, the Pink Lemonade was just a bit sour for me.  I only take one a day and right before I go to the gym.  I compare this to Advocare's ""Spark"" drink and this product is WAY CHEAPER but contains just about the same things!  Awesome for those on a budget.<br />Some may be confused by what seems like an excess of vitamins on the ingredient label.  But any that you dont use up in the day get flushed from your body though your kidneys.  DO NOT TAKE MORE THAN 3 a day it says on the vile, but I only need one in the morning to help me rip though my workouts.<br /><br />I do not drink caffine in any other form because I am very sensitive to it. But with this drink I have not had a problem, I thought that it would make me jittery or feel awful, but this product does no such thing!  After the gym I am good to go though the time I get home and I sleep fine!"
360,Bruce L. Ishimatsu,5,"Go ahead and drink the other brands served at your neighborhood cafe if you must but make sure you have a stash of Weaver's Peru Organic Whole Bean at home to serve up to your friends and family who deserve the best coffee.  And when you go back to that corner cafe where people drink average coffee because they don't know better, take along a travel mug filled with Weaver's coffee from home and enjoy a real Cup of Joe.  Er, Weaver's."
127183,"Sharon S. Walker ""BookLoverAzleTexas""",5,A friend introduced me to biscotti several years ago.  I never thought it was something I would like.  It looked like dried melba toast.<br />Guess what!  It's the best stuff.  So good with a cup of coffee.  And Nonni's is the best.
3581,CH,5,This is a keeper flavor -- hope Tic Tac removes pink grapefruit from the limited edition category.  Citrus flavor seems especially potent to freshen your mouth after eating onion/garlic.
506423,"Michelle Kennedy ""snarky one""",5,"My cats love the Ziwi Peak ""Good Cat"" treats. In fact, my youngest loves them so much that she will bite and destroy the bags to get to the treats. They're flat and small, like pieces of jerky, and some cats take a little time to figure out how to eat them. I've given them to friends and family with cats, and all in all, every single cat likes them...<br />And they're grain free, all natural treats, so you don't feel guilty about giving them to your kitties!"
241717,icr35,5,"This is the best deal I've found on this formula, especially because they are the bigger cans and ship for free. I supplement my breastmilk with EB; I find that my son digests it much more easily and that his bowel movments have become more regular as opposed to other brands I've tried. Much easier to mix with warm or room temperature water."
78958,Jennifer R. Creamer,5,Just a little makes many cups of delicious tea. It's my favorite loose leaf earl grey.
414666,"Jacob Hantla ""hantla.com""",5,"The beverage flowing from Dolce Gusto's Chococino pods is a great cup of hot chocolate. I have not had better ""instant"" hot chocolate. The flavor is comparable to that coming from some of the more expensive packet-based mixes, but with none of the heating, stirring, clumping, and residue at the bottom of the cup.<br /><br />What I love about the Dolce Gusto that showed itself well with this beverage is the simplicity & cleanliness. Whenever I make myself hot chocolate, I will inevitably drop powder on the counter or spill all over the cup while I'm stirring. Dolce Gusto is simple, clean, and quick.<br /><br />The cost, however, must be considered. The chococino (like the cappucino  and the latte macchiatto) takes two pods: a milk pod and a flavor pod. At Amazon's current pricing, that makes each beverage just more than one dollar apiece. This is worth it for me compared to the cheaper cost of the mixes because we drink hot chocolate so infrequently. Compared to the cost of Starbucks hot chocolate, this is a bargain. But the cost is certainly not negligible if you drink it often.<br /><br />Chococino will likely be the only hot chocolate made in my house from now on."
512858,FYI,5,"This does not taste artificial. It's delicious! Better tasting than most actual pulpy peaches these days. You'd have to have the tastebuds of a Macho Montana Iguana to not enjoy savoring this tea. I know whereof I speak, having entertained an Irascible Iguana who only deigned to eat raw elk-burger. Then he'd run around and try to bite the cat's tail. He grew large and monstrous on elk-burger, but would never eat a peach, or any other foodstuff he was supposed to like, aside from meat.<br /><br />So, go for it. Be an Uniguana and drink your serene peach tea sweetened with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I6JPQQ"">Splenda No Calorie Sweetener, Granular, Individual Packets, 700-Count Box</a>. This true peach adds to the fantastic spectrum of Celestial Season's flavors. PS: The cat was given to a rural artist, grew large and happy, and did not miss the lizard."

I haven't tried a flavor yet they didn't eat right up and lick their bowls clean.  My 2 cats love it so much that I have started to feed our little poodle the tiki dog and he actually dances around for it!  The company is quite impressive as well and after the fiasco with Wellness a few months ago, it is good to know there are still companies out there who are all about quality."
50316,"Pamela V ""&#34;MS V&#34;""",5,"Don't expect anything fancy with this cake mix; you have to buy this for the taste alone.  It rises unevenly, as do the other cake mixes I've purchased from Naturally Nora.  The flavor is subtle and sublime.  It's perfect with her chocolate frosting.  Good enough for birthdays or everyday."
38380,Kimberly Nguyen,5,"My boyfriend was looking for a high energy trail mix especially when he's out early on the golf course and nothing compares to this Tropical Blend. It gives him the energy throughout the round without crashing like those energy drinks, plus it's healthy! You get a bit of sweetness, tartiness, and saltiness which is a great combination for what he needed. He highly recommends this trail mix if you want a snack that will lift you up!"

My 15 month old is gluten free and I wanted to make him a PB&J (well almond butter and jelly -- peanut allergy as well!) he is allergic to eggs too so I used Ener-G egg replacer and baked it in the oven. I didn't cook it long enough though, although I think my oven isn't as hot as it should be.  My 4 year old loved it as well, told me she wanted 2 slices in her lunch for school!

Since we discovered the pill pockets (he loves the chicken variety), giving him a pill has been a breeze.

I can't imagine needing to shove a pill down our dog's throat again."

I use Cytomax exclusively.  I've tried others - Hammer, Gatorade, Accelerade, etc, but find Cytomax best for me.  It's easy on my stomach and not and provides the needed energy/electrolytes for long rides.  My personal preference is to do 1 1/2 scoops per water bottle rather than the 2 that they reccomend because 2 scoops makes it too sweet for me.

408797,"C. Munson ""Got Pharm?""",5,These are a good idea in the snack size bags because they are so addictive and yummy.  Great to dip but even better plain.

370796,Jen,5,"I bought some of this mix at a farmer's market on a trip to Oregon. I made it as soon as I got home. It was easy- add 2/3 cup of water, shape, and bake! The scones were delicious with tea and coffee. I wish I had bought more, I'm glad I can now!"
525726,Robin V Williams,5,"I tried this in a sample and really loved it, after which I ordered 3 bags and gave one away to a friend, who also loves it.  You should try it!"
555909,diljs,5,"For those of you unfamiliar with white tea, it comes from the same plant as green tea, and has all the health benefits.  White tea is picked during a small period of the year, before the buds and leaves have opened.  This gives it a much more delicate flavor (read: doesn't taste like cabbage the way green tea does).<br /><br />For those of you who are tea snobs, this is Bai Mu Dan (aka white peony), which is picked from March 15-April 10 of each year.  It is not quite as rare as silver needle, and has a bit more flavor.<br /><br />I was looking for some white tea for a regular morning cup, and I came across this bag, with a very low cost per ounce.  I'd ordered Numi before and liked it so I took a chance and was not disappointed.  Mine came in a large black, resealable bag, rather than the paper one pictured.  It is quite a bit of tea for the price.  The leaves and buds are in good condition, large and mostly unbroken (see my user image for an example), and dried to a nice green color like they should be.<br /><br />The tea has a great flavor, more substantial than silver needle, but still very light and drinkable.  I'd definitely order this again, but I'll be a while going through the 1lb bag."

Great with coffee for breakfast!"

519431,R. Russell,5,"The first time I tried Indian pickle, it was quite a shock. So salty and sour. An Indian friend was quite humored by my trying it. He said it is a staple of college students in India. The mistake I had made when I tried it was, I added to one of those MRE style Indian meals that are already salty. When added to homemade food it is divine, it adds that extra something to what your eating."
195483,lookingforfunworkout,5,"Yes, this is grainy. So if you're buying it, be prepared for that and you won't be disappointed!  I quickly adjusted to the texture and actually crave it.  It is amazing on scones, biscuits, toast, bagels and pretty much anything else we've tried to put it on.  AMAZING on naan bread when being eaten w/ an Indian meal."

It is a great, healthy popcorn that has just a slight caramel apple flavor, not overpowering.  If you're expecting a heavy caramel covered popcorn, this isn't it.  This is my favorite popcorn hands down!"

260474,Julie,5,"After making plain biscuits, which were the best I tasted since going gluten free, I came up with a few recipes. My husband has no allergies but will eat any of these.<br /><br />#1-- Herb Biscuits - When making a double batch of biscuits (10-12), I add 1 TBSP. each of garlic powder, onion powder, chives, and parsley. (find the amount that suits you best) I also like to add a packet of Chreese (GF Dairy Free cheese sauce mix) While I still miss Red Lobster's biscuits, these are quite tasty.<br /><br />#2-- Shortcake - Use vanilla flavored soy or almond milk and add a little sweetener of choice to your biscuit mix. Top with your favorite fresh or frozen fruit.<br /><br />#3-- Chicken Pot Pie - Prepare biscuit mix with a little extra milk or broth,  two cans cream soup, a cup of frozen veggies and leftover boneless chicken chunks. Bake at 350 degrees in a pie pan until done (about 30 minutes)<br /><br />Enjoy!"
112186,"Ms. Susan L. Duncan Rn ""southlily""",5,"I tested most of the cheddar soy chips available online and this one had the best taste and texture. You can't go wrong with these. Also, costs less than a bag of potato chips and is WAY better for you."

I don't even make the entire packet up at once--I sprinkle a little into a glass and add water and crushed ice plus some mint from my garden.  I do think they are a little overpriced, perhaps because of the limited supply. Hopefully they'll bring it back soon and be widely available in stores."
244926,Juiblex,5,The consistency is very fine. Properly mixed it wont even think of acting lumpy in whatever you put it in.<br />You'll want to have a container handy so you can protect it from moisture. Would hate to have it clump together.<br />This is perfect for marinades and sauces.<br />It is a little on the weak side though. Not sure why.

39253,Paul Moskowitz,5,"I always keep a box of these bars in my refrigerator.<br /><br /> If I had never seen the Fruit and Nut bars before, one look at the label would tell me that they are not particularly healthful.  The ingredients include corn syrup, honey, and sugar listed twice.  In fact, there are 14 grams of sugar in every 34 gram bar.  That is forty percent!  Although the label does claim all natural ingredients, that does not necessarily mean that the contents are all good for you.<br /><br /> The sugar seems to be what holds the fruit and nuts together.  The reason that I keep them in the refrigerator is that when the bars get warm, they do not hold their shape.  You do not want to put one in your pocket on a warm day.  They become a sticky blob.<br /><br /> So why do I keep a big supply of them around?  I like them.  When cooled, they keep their shape as a crunchy rectangle of nuts and fruit.  Their nutty texture is very nice.  The taste is great, although the sugar does make its presence known.  I do not eat them every day or take them with me to go hiking.  For that, I like the Oats and Honey, Almond, or Peanut Butter varieties of Nature Valley granola bars.  Those varieties have a more reasonable sugar content.  However, I like a Fruit and Nut bar as an occasional treat to go with tea or coffee.  Maybe I am addicted to them."
429421,Ira Sacharoff,5,"This is a great product. Coconut has been vilified by some in previous years for being a saturated fat, and therefore unhealthy, but more recent evidence suggests that although it is a saturated fat, it is a different type of saturated fat than the saturated fats in animal products, and in fact is especially healthy. The more recent evidence suggests that coconut, especially coconut oil, helps with weight loss and is heart healthy.<br /><br />All I know is that it fits in well with a lower carbohydrate diet, has plenty of fiber, and can be used in many recipes.<br /><br />In fact, I'm about to have my hot brekafast cereal containing almond meal and coconut."

318234,"L. Cheeley ""Mom of 7""",5,"1st, 4 Tbs of this hemp protein has 7g of fiber, 10g of protein, all 10 essential amino acids, is rich in omega-3 & 6's, and is soy-free, dairy-free & gluten-free.  Cals are 120, carbs 13g including 7g of sugar, and fat is at 3g.  I have never used hemp before & was very skeptical that I was going to be able to choke this down, esp when I saw the color!  However, I mixed 4 T with 1 C orange juice, 1 large strawberry & 1/2 banana & it was quite delicious!  A real treat for breakfast.  Calorie count on that smoothie came to 270 with 10g of fiber.  I can't taste much of the vanilla spice flavor in my mixture so I think I will buy the original flavor next time since it is less expensive.  You could easily put this in a veggie casserole w/o any one (i.e. my kids) noticing.  The flavor is very mild, & not at all grainy or chalky."

96,Rhiever,5,"My 1-1/2 year old basenji/jack russell mix loves this dog food. He's been noticeably healthier and more energetic since I switched him over from the standard dog foods earlier this year. Despite the higher cost of natural dog foods, I find that he eats significantly less of the Natural Balance dog foods and still stays happy and full. On the normal dog foods, he'd eat up to 3 cups of dog food a day (the recommended serving for his size), whereas he only eats about 1 cup to 1-1/2 cup of the Natural Balance dog food a day. When you take this into account, you're actually getting more ""bang for your buck"" with the natural dog foods since you don't have to buy as much to last just as long as the normal dog foods... and a healthier, happier dog, to boot! Add in the fact that you can get free, 2-day shipping with Amazon Prime... I'm sold!!"

157546,M. Armstrong-Hough,5,"This is a lovely, unsweetened, Japanese-style true green tea.  It is NOT your typical American tea with added corn syrup or sickeningly sweet artificial sweeteners, so if you are looking for a sweet tea you should skip it.  But it is a delicious, smooth, non-bitter green tea... and that is *very* hard to find outside of East Asia.<br /><br />My work takes me to Japan with some frequency, where I became a fan of conveniently bottled cool green teas.  This is the only tea I have found readily available in the U.S. that matches the quality and taste I expect in Japan. (Ito En is, after all, a Japanese company.)<br /><br />If you can't stand the oversweetened stuff that passes for bottled tea in North America and enjoy the taste of straight green tea, this product is probably a good fit for you."
526087,Can't Think Of A Name,5,"I love Frontier's Herbes De Provence. Love love love it. I first got it at the health food store bulk section to try and feel in love with it. Was thrilled to find it on Amazon at such a nice price and have bought it here for several years. I ran out last year and couldn't find it anywhere except in wee little bottles that don't last long and cost a ridiculous amount compared to the wonderful price per pound here. Also as I have multiple food allergies I *hate* changing brands for fear of cross contamination. I have never had a problem with Frontier so they must be conscientious in their mixing and packing of their products for which I am very grateful. This time I am ordering two extra pounds to make sure I have enough to last me until next season :) I love to put this on chicken and potatoes. Put it under the skin of chicken or turkey whole or parts or just sprinkled on skinless portions. It is awesome on potatoes. my family loves a stove top dish of chicken, potatoes, sweet potatoes and green beans (frozen are fine) sprinkled with Herbes de Provence."
295779,K. B. Fenner,5,"I love this stuff toasted--it is positively addictive --especially with peanut butter or real butter (shhh). It is all whole grain, so very good for you. Beware, though--it makes a messy sandwich unless you toast it or melt cheese on it first--it falls apart."

Beetlejuice will leave you laughing 'til you cry,(or just crying.)"
37792,Herrick,5,"Out of the three varieties I tried (Chickpeas, Black Gram Lentils, and Mashed Vegetable), this one is my favorite. As many other reviewers pointed out, it's very high in sodium so it should be split into two meals. I like to cook some ground beef beforehand and mix it into the curry to make it more satiating for the same sodium load. Also, when mixed with the Chickpeas curry, it's delicious! Awesome food for college students, fast and easy."

With 5 kitty mouths to feed, the whole case would be gone in about 4 or 5 days if everybody got the Spot's Stew, so I put some other favorites out also and pretty soon everyone is satisfied. Since no cat eats a whole can at one sitting, those poor things that had to ""settle"" for Trout or some such later wander over and get their fair share of the stew. I have been so pleased with it, that I plan to order in other flavors that are also 5 star winners.<br />But, at our house, WHOLESOME CHICKEN AND BEEF are definite winners and we all recommend them to all who are looking for something to hit the spot with their felines!"

I have eaten entirely too many this week after discovering them because I was waiting for them to have a strange after taste or make my tummy funny, but no, these cookies are just perfect. The calories aren't too bad either. It's something like 36 calories per cookie.

My husband is a waffle afficionado and we usually get waffle mix from Williams & Sonoma and/or Bouchon Bakery, but I can't often bring myself to pay $12+ for waffle mix or wait two hours for the yeast to work its magic.  I tried this mix since it had used natural ingredients.  I was nervous when the first waffle came out of the iron.  They looked flatter than I was expecting, but when I bit into it, I was pleasantly surprised by the fluffiness.  My husband really enjoyed them too and I think this may become our go to brand when we're in a hurry.  Now I'm thinking of trying their brownie or cookie mix.  I don't like to bake from mixes, but this is one I can feel good about using."

256184,babynp,5,These bars are really good. They are chewy and crunchy with a fruity flavor. At 100 calories each they make a perfect snack and are easily kept in your purse or even pocket. Love them.
204315,Fairfare,5,"After reading the reviews I absolutely had to write one myself. The product is awsome convenient and reasonably priced being you get 3 servings of fruit in one bag.<br /><br />The reason I had to write the review is due to the arrogance of the people rating this product below a 3 star rating IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT FREEZ-DRIED MEANS, DON'T WRITE A BAD REVIEW, DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH. You all sound like idiots, if you buy a Lamborghini you can't complain it goes too fast."
75752,"Sandra Trolinger ""trolsgirl""",5,These are expensive per can but testing it out was a pleasant surprise as I liked the fruit juice taste and there was no after taste and it went down smooth. It would be great for mixed drinks too for parties but I just used it as a supplement to lunch and I didn't want to nap around 3 pm when my energy usually dips. Very impressed that I didn't feel jittery or nauseated after drinking it either. I MUCH prefer this one over Red Bull.
35299,aj,5,"These are the best Somersaults I've tried yet.  They're lightly salted and a tad spicy--not hot at all, but with flavors of pepper and spices.  At this price I'll be keeping my subscription going!"

314895,"Ambergris ""John Thomas""",5,"A good hearty veggie beef soup has always been one of my favorite meals.  Especially on a cold winter day when I make it in a crock pot.  Although I enjoy making soup from scratch when I have the time, I often use various mixes that add all the spices and ingredients for you.  As you may expect, some mixes are much better than others.  I decided to try the Bear Creek brand when I saw it here for I have never seen it in any stores.  Take it from me, it makes really great soup that is rich and spicy, but not with too much of anything added to make it overpowering.  Its also the kind of mix that takes kindly to anything extra that you may enjoy adding to it like other reviewers have suggested. I recommend it for its price is very reasonable, and even more for its delicious....Bon Appetite!"
285320,"Cookbook Gal ""Cookbook Gal""",5,"I ordered this tea in a restaurant the first time and it was so good that I asked for the name and stocked up.  It is fantastic; not bitter at all with a mild, sweet pineapple flavor in the background.  Great hot or iced. Recommendation:  each bag contains about a tablespoon of tea leaves.  If you like a stronger brew, I recommend getting the loose tea.  I travel with the tea bags and use the loose tea at home."
83570,Aaron Brown,5,"I generally like the stronger coffees.  A lot of the k-cups have been very weak and flavorless.  I have nearly finished my first order of the Fog Chaser and it is one of the better coffees I've had for the Keurig.  The k-cups are little different than the traditional plastic cups, but who cares?  And I can't figure out what ""smell"" other reviewers are talking about.  When you open a bag, it smells like ground COFFEE.  Uh, that is not a bad thing.  It is because the cups are made of a breathable filter pouch.  What does a box of regular K-cups smell like?  Plastic cups?<br />Each twelve comes in its own sealed plastic bag so I am not worried about them going stale unless it takes you a couple months to drink 12 cups.  And the price is much lower than most of the of the other brands.  I can't see spending 1 1/2 to 2 times as much for coffee that is either not as good or at best just as good.  I singed up for the subscribe and save to get it delivered regularly so I dont run out.  I just hope others find it as great tasting as I do so amazon keeps carrying it!"

156676,"PeterOM ""peterom""",5,"This is a hot sauce that is a bit different from others I have tried.  One difference is its first two ingredients (Papaya and Aged Pickled Scotch Bonnet Peppers).  Because of the Scotch Bonnet peppers, it is fairly hot and the papaya gives it an interesting taste.  This sauce has been a good accompaniment to hamburgers, chicken and pork."
58418,Sharon Anne,5,"The brand of sweet dough flavoring is delicious. It tastes buttery, with a hint of vanilla and a slight blend of citrus! It's almost magical in baking sweet breads, sugar cookies and especially cinnamon rolls. The aroma conjures wonderful memories from my youth, smells like inside the Disneyland Main Street Blue Ribbon Bakery!<br /><br />It quite potent, so you needn't add much, but when you do, people will ask you for the recipe and what's your secret to success.

250180,trollbaby,5,"I am super picky about tea. I am forever disappointed that restaurants and cafes, even high end ones, have such crappy tea bags. This Assam is far and away the best one that is currently on the market in bags. It is rich, smooth and bold all at the same time. I do not leave home without these tea bags in my purse. I'm not sure why people are complaining about the packaging. Yes, they are individually wrapped, however I much prefer them this way. This tea is delicious. As usual, Amazon has the very best price."
13929,"K. Brizo ""kbwoof15""",5,I find that the buffalo chicken jerky is great for when I'm craving buffalo wings late at night. Sure they're not the saucy goodness of wings at a bar but they definitely replicate the flavor. They are very hot but delicious.

528872,K. McGee,5,"I admit I'm kind of a wimp when it comes to hot spicy things. For that reason, lots of times I end up not liking hot wings which can be disheartening after you've gone to all the expense and work to create the wings. With this packet, I get the spicy flavor without so much of the heat.<br /><br />I've used McCormick's Buffalo wing mix on boneless tenders, wings and legs and always had good results. You just coat your chicken pieces and place in your pre-heated oven. Super easy!<br /><br />The only downside is if you like the skin on your chicken to be crispy, then it's a bit hard to do with this because it tends to brown/blacken somewhat easily both in the oven - I tried to crisp using the broiler in the oven - and out on the grill. You can get it a little crispy but you have to watch it like a hawk because one second it'll look fine and the next, it's blackening.<br /><br />Bottom line: Tastes really good without being horribly hot, easy to use and I can even find it in the small town I live in."
30680,Cuckoomamma,5,"As other reviewers have pointed out, these crunch dried apples have their own unique consistency.  I find them to be much more like other freeze dried snacks as opposed to the consistency of a dried apple.  Because of food allergies, we're quite limited in what fruits our children can eat and what can be added to them.  It was truly a relief to find organic apple snacks without a list of additives and other fruits mixed in.  While others may prefer different types of fruits mixed together, we need snacks that are limited to the fruit that mentioned.  For example, fruit leathers often include pear even when they're listed as grape fruit leather.  These are what they claim to be...apple!<br /><br />The second most important aspect for us is that these snacks are from the USA.  Unlike the other brands, these are not from China.  We make every effort to avoid toys from China, and definitely have no interest in eating food from China.<br /><br />While these are extremely expensive, amazon makes them more affordable than my supermarket.  Because of the food allergies, we have so few snacks we can eat on the go.  These are a nice alternative to cuttting up apples and packing them."

400049,"E. A. Jones ""movie buff""",5,"After one can, I'm hooked on this cappuccino.  The taste of Illy Issimo is absolutely stellar.  The coffee itself is very good, the best I've had in a canned coffee.  It's the closest to a fresh iced coffee taste I've found.  The blend of coffee and milk in their cappuccino is just right, not too much milk and it's not too sweet, either. I found the caffeine to be pretty gentle.  The can says 81 mg of caffeine per can, which seemed high but I did not get the jitters or a crash later on.  At 100 calories a can, it's not going to ruin your diet, either.<br /><br />I've been buying various coffees in cans and jars for years, and had not yet found one I really loved. Another popular brand has a cappuccino which is far too sweet and an espresso which is overcaffeinated.  I hope to see this in local stores soon."

103563,Alex S,5,"I love this product.  It does not have any added sugar and has more potassium than a banana.  This one has pulp in it which is like little pieces of the flesh cut up into small cubes like 1/4 in by 1/4 of inch(easy to swallow).  They sell a pulp free version if texture is an issue for you.  Best served cold, Coconut juice is refreshing and tasty."

I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for small snack bags of pop chips that can easily be transported when going out and about or given to hungry kids while in the car.

66834,Joseph Oppenheim,5,"If you want a snack which is both delicious and healthy, this works. As for it stating, ""love at first bite,"" I can't say that. The berries were freeze dried which really didn't add much to the mix, taste-wise. Plus, the cost might be prohibitive for some, though for a special occasion, it probably would be a welcome change-of-pace treat. So, overall, it pleases just fine."

102448,J. Phillips,5,"We have been feeding our Bulldog this food for almost all of the 6 years we have had him and he loves it.  We have noticed consistently small stools, virtually no gas, great skin and coat health, and best of all, our dog has never gotten tired of this food.  We normally mix in a different brand every six months or so to keep things interesting for him, but every time we have tried another food on its own without the Royal Canin, our dog does seem happy or interested.<br /><br />Another great point of this food is how little our dog eats.  He is about 75 lbs. and only eats 2 cups of food a day.  His weight stays consistent with only daily walks.  He is an apartment dog and sometimes it is difficult to get him a lot of exercise.<br /><br />We are very happy with this food and so is our dog.

But you will learn to test it and get it right every time and oh, it is SO worth it! My family doesn't even know they aren't eating ""regular"" pasta.<br />Every variety of the Ancient Harvest Quinoa Pasta is exceptionally good.

Kopi Luwak has been on my ""bucket list"" for tasting ever since I saw the Nicholson/Freeman movie of note.  I made it according to the instructions:  10.0 grams of medium fine grind to 6.0 oz of filtered water.  Stir it; let it sit for a couple of minutes; strain it into a second cup.  Mmmm...Pure, strong, rich coffee flavor with not a trace of bitterness.  When the cup is gone, the aftertaste lasts and lasts.  A really great coffee and I am glad to have made its acquaintance."
195401,WKP,5,"The Solo Lemon Lift bars are the best tasting bars out there!  Great lemon taste and a good texture.

404382,"Eric R. Kirk ""Thanks for reading, Eric.""",5,"This coffee is just outstanding. I don't even know where to start. Umm lets start with the amount of pure Arabica (not cheaper Robusta beens) coffee you get for just 10-12 bucks. 2.5 lbs that's just crazy cheap, but the flavor is anything but cheap. This coffee is probably the best I have tasted. It's very dark and rich, full body, and no bitterness. I use an aerobie coffee maker 2 scoops of this coffee and it makes some darn good espresso. I normally make a American style coffee, buy filling the mug up with hot water. Just the best cup of coffee and the price is so low it's almost a joke. Most things in life you get what you pay for. Well with this coffee you get way more then you paid for and that's nice now a days. I would also like to add that I have also recently bought (Lavazza Qualita Rossa) that was three times the price of Pilon Espresso. It was just horrible. Bad aroma, very bitter, and 2nd rate beans (Robusta). Again for the price you can't beat this coffee. As far as a drip coffee maker, I don't have one. So it might turn out differently for you. I do recommended get a aerobie coffee maker and this coffee."
475089,John Public,5,"It seems like every time I find a really good product, the manufacturer stops making it. (The garbage products keep getting made year after year).  This product is no longer available at any of the stores around me.<br /><br />Luzianne makes great green tea.  It is, of course, not as strong as black tea. The taste is smooth.  The caffeine level is not too bad.  I like making sun tea with the larger bags. 4 bags to the gallon and 4 hours of sunshine makes fantastic tea.  If you want it stronger just squeeze excess liquids from the bags when removing.<br /><br />I just hope Amazon keeps selling this stuff in bulk.  The price ($25/case) is very good.  This is the only food product I have ever bought online."
541443,Gloria,5,"I love Instant Breakfast and especially the Dark Chocolate flavor. I drink this product every morning as part of my breakfast. Unfortunately, local stores do not distribute the Dark Chocolate flavor so I make do with Milk Chocolate. This prohibits me from purchasing it at a reasonable price so I have had to resort to mail orders or email orders which I find inconvenient. Perhaps if more people would try this flavor it would get wider regular distribution."
20948,New York Mama,5,"I love these chips!  They're all natural, gluten free, and relatively low in fat and calories (130 calories and 5 grams of fat per 1 ounce serving).  I've tried the white cheddar, butter and sea salt flavors.  All three are good but the white cheddar is definitely my favorite.  The flavor is similar to Pirates Booty but the texture is more like a thick chip.  It has a very satisfying crunch.<br /><br />These sell for $3.99 per bag at my local grocery store which makes the Amazon pricing a great deal."
407900,Corinne,5,I have a yorkie/Maltese and she is very sensitive to food. She was under weight and had rashes from regular dog food. She would throw up some and had runny poop. I tried this product as well as some higher priced products for a month each and then decided on this one due to the results and price. Bonnie puppy is now a healthy weight and her skin rash has cleared up. Highly recommended for any pet with digestive problems and or skin issues. Maltese breeds have highly sensitive systems so if u are having digestive system problems then u should read up on your breed and see if it is a food allergy.  This product worked for my brothers Maltese as well that was underweight. Ended up being a digestion issue.

296579,"Proberta Gerber ""wine snob""",5,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00014VTNW"">Marmite 125g</a><br />Marmite is one of those things that people seem to either love or hate.  I'm in the former camp.  I think the way I was introduced to it has a lot to do with my positive impression.  Marmite is very salty and rich, it's almost like a bouillon cube softened with butter.  Well, not quite that salty.  The British friends who gave me my first taste knew how to eat it and taught me right.  /;+)<br /><br />The British supposedly eat it on their toast to help boost their Vitamin B levels, as tea inhibits the absorption of B vitamins.  And we all know the Brits drink a lot of tea.  I look upon it as a stress reliever that tastes good, too.<br /><br />Try it on toasted French bread, spread with lots of melty butter.  Then, ever so lightly, spread a thin, very thin film of Marmite over the top.  It should be barely tan on the ridges of the bread's surface, unless of course you find you like this salty spread, then have at it.<br /><br />Tea, toast with Marmite, and a simple scrambled egg make a satisfying and tasty meal.  Give it a try.<br /><br />Added 10 May 2008:  I posted this review before tasting the ""new"" Marmite.  I had been using up my stash of Marmite from before they started getting PC and health conscious and all that nasty stuff.  The new Marmite is less flavorful, thinner, and really not too appealing for a fan of the original version - I think it must be the veggie-no meat flavor.  You can carmelize veggies until the cows come home (heh!), but they will never have as rich a flavor as beef.  Unless, hmmm, maybe miso???  That's got a pretty rich flavor without meat.  Maybe I need to add that to my ""new"" Marmite.  Excuse the digression.<br /><br />If you've never tried Marmite before, never fear.  It's still got all the positives I mentioned at the top, but, for us fans of the beefy version, it's a little tame."
105245,"Anne Kathleen ""Mirror Star""",5,"I have to admit that I'm a Crystal Light addict. I've probably tried every flavor they make. For a sugar-free product, it has a bold, great taste, and I don't notice an aftertaste from the sugar substitute either. Pink Lemonade is my favorite flavor because I find many of the fruit flavored ones are a little too sweet for my taste. My second favorite is the cranberry flavored Crystal Light and my third favorite is the orange flavored one (these two not yet offered by amazon as of this writing).<br /><br />As well as being an excellent drink on its own, as an added bonus for those who are dieting but still like to imbibe, Crystal Light is a great alternative to the high-sugar, high-calorie drink mixers. The pink lemonade works in any drinks recipe calling for lemonade, the orange is great in a Tequila Sunrise, and the cranberry is great for a vodka & cranberry.<br /><br />Cheers!<br />Anne K."

(25oz eliminates the frustrating last bit at the bottom, anything smaller store the remaining in a drawer in the corner upside down so you can squeeze the rest in the bottle without fighting with it too much, by the time you get to that second half in the bottle it'll be where you want it and you don't come out the shower looking like you got into a fight with a Dove Soap Deep Moistruizing Body wash bottle...

65622,"Patricia ""A Reader""",5,"Some tea, (""herbal"" teas), say they are different.  They are.  To my admittedly middle-class, (but striving to go upward!) tastes, herbal tea is awful.  ""Regular"", bagged American tea is not far behind, (but at least is palatable.)  I count myself very, very fortunate, though, to have sampled the delightful, tasty, wonderous delights of loose, pure Jasmine Tea, Fortum and Mason's delightful ""Royal Blend Tea"", F&M's ""Queen Mary Tea"", and the wonderous ""English Blend"" tea, put out by several manufacturers, including the now sadly deceased, (it was far too good a company to judge its wares 'defunct'), Jackson's of Picadilly.  ALL these ""fancy"" teas were wonderous, and wonderously different from the ""ordinary"" tea one usually finds on supermarket shelves.  Alas -- all these ""extraordinary"" teas had extra-ordinarily high prices -- which, sadly, keep on climbing.<br /><br />Tetley's British Blend Tea is a very happy medium!  Not quite as tasty as my favourite, pure Jasmine tea, Tetley's British Blend is still, wonderously, delightfully, and quite tastily, different and delicious!  It has a nice, full, rich flavoUr, as in NO (other?)supermarket tea I have ever found!  It is a ""hidden treasure"" in the supermarket -- and here in Amazon's grocery, as well.  I like to think of it like me -- a person of modest means who is working hard to try to find a way to enjoy the best things in life, for myself and those whom I love.  I would daresay that this ""Tetley's British Blend Tea"", (so neatly and conveniently placed into round, but otherwise, deceptively ""ordinary"" tea bags), is, indeed, ""the tea of the American Dream""! : )<br /><br />To make the best tea, I've found that one should boil the water.  A lot.  THEN LET THE WATER RST FOR A FEW HOURS.  When the water is cold, let the water come to a boil again....but J U S T to a boil.<br />(If you lack the time for this, then just bring the water JUST to a boil the first time.)  Mmmmmm...absolutely first-rate!!!!<br /><br />P.S.:  I do hope that Amazon is able to sell this wonderous tea forever, and that the ""only 3 left"" does not betoken either Amazon's<br />slow sales on this (hidden!) treasure....or, (worse!) Tetley's decision not to manufacture it any more(!)?  If either is the case, and no more can be had by the usual channels, either on Amazon or in the supermarket.....watch Ebay....and watch the prices soar for the remaining boxes!<br /><br />Please keep making this tea, (Tetley), and selling this tea, (Amazon), forever!<br /><br />In the meantime, I'm going to end this review, and buy some right now!"

Before I was always brewing a larger pot than I needed and throwing a lot out, or drinking more than I really wanted so as not to waste it.  Even though the K-cups are more expensive, just knowing I can make one cup of great coffee anytime the mood strikes is great! Sometimes I want one cup after dinner and this is perfect!  I've read some of these reviews talking about the cup sizes; if I select the large cup serving, it almost runs out of a regular/medium cup,especially if I pre-add a little half & half.

I always look at the list of ingredients for the word, ""hydrogenated"" even when the label says ""no trans fat.""<br /><br />They're not too sweet, with a slight taste of blueberry and brown sugar. I agree with other reviewers that they have an addictive quality to them, and with only 140 calories for three cookies (about 47 calories per cookie), one could get into trouble by overindulging. My husband and I really liked these, however.<br /><br />These would be perfect for dunking in milk or crumbling over ice cream. Enjoy!"

106331,teacher-mom,5,My whole family loves this cornbread!  It is moist and so tasty that it doesn't even need butter or honey.  It's honestly better than the cornbread that I used to make that contained gluten.  Thank you Pamela's!
316504,"Shirley Priscilla  Johnson ""Author/Reviewer -...",5,"I have always enjoyed this type of cracker so I was happy to have a chance to review this one.  I was very impressed with the packaging. I can't tell you how many times different crackers or cookies have gone stale on me because they were not closed properly. This will not happen with this product.  They have several packs inside  with just the right amount of crackers to enjoy at one sitting, or they are perfect to pop in your purse and take along with you. The flavor and texture were great. They were very fresh and none of them were stale. That is such a major factor in my opinion. I will definitely look for these in my local store. A very good product in all ways that I gladly recommend."

538586,"Cheryl D. Millard ""Cheryl D. Millard""",5,"An excellent product at an excellent price.<br />This product is pre-washed and ready to cook without the bitter saponin taste. I do recommended rinsing all quinoa once anyways.<br />In reply to a previous review,  if this product was not prewashed then it would have a bitter after taste.<br /><br />In it's natural state before quinoa is washed, the grains are coated with a bitter tasting natural pest repellent called saponin, which discourages insects and birds from eating the seeds.<br /><br />The 25 pound arrived fast and in perfect condition, the grains are of a mature size and there isn't any foreign ""things"" mixed in with the quinoa. I will be ordering again if the price stays competitive. My boyfriend is indigenous Quechua and we eat a lot of quinoa the 25lbs will last 3 months if we are lucky.

The bottom line is you might have to try both to get the one you need."

208187,Timothy B. Riley,5,"Having lived in the US all of my life (although I have traveled quite a bit) I had never heard of Marmite until last week.  I've been participating in an on-line, UK based think-tank dealing with international brands and digital advertising.  As we discussed products that we grew up with and are still loyal to Marmite came up several times.  I looked at some Marmite ads (the British call them ""adverts""), and then searched for it on Amazon.  Being a dedicated foodie I decided to give it a shot.  Here is my impression:<br /><br />When I first opened the glass jar and gave it a whiff it seemed oddly familiar.  I put just a dab on my spoon and tasted it straight.  Again, strangely familiar.  The taste was very strong, almost condensed.  I could taste the beer-like yeast but I was also getting a savory, deep vegetable flavor. Then it hit me.<br /><br />I love to make sauces and I often use pre-made glaces and demi-glaces which have a very thick consistency when gently heated (before heating they are almost solid).  They come in many different varieties: beef; duck; veal; chicken; lamb; seafood; mushroom; vegetable; etc.  Marmite has a strong resemblance to a straight, undiluted, vegetable glace.  Pungent, earthy and with that quality that the Japanese refer to as ""Umami"".  WOW!  Who knew?  Well, I guess a lot of people did but it was new to me.  Now, what to do with it...<br /><br />My on-line British friends gave me some sage advice: use it sparingly and on some sort of bread with butter.  I bought some fresh English Muffin bread from a local artisan bakery shop, lightly toasted it, coated it thinly with about 2/3 teaspoon of Marmite and spread some salted Vermont cultured butter onto it.  HEAVEN!  The Marmite balanced out the heaviness of the butter perfectly.  That gave me the inspiration for my next test.  I've alway loved a toasted bagel with cream cheese or Marscapone but need something to cut the palate-coating fat of the cheese besides a slice of onion (lox works well if you have it).  Marmite fit the bill technically, but I think that I will have to get used to the combination.  Still, I will keep using it here for a while and I think that it might become a favorite for me.<br /><br />Next I tried it in a simple sauce.  I browned a tablespoon of finely chopped shallots in 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter (who am I kidding? I used 2 tablespoons of butter).  After the shallots were browned I added 3 tablespoons of Marite and 1 teaspoon of water.  I reduced it a little and added 1/3 cup of heavy cream, a small bouquet garnet in cheesecloth and 1 tablespoon of dry sherry. I reduced it by about half and adjusted the strength by adding more Marmite (I needed more, maybe I should have used less cream).  When finished it tasted really good, not great but it could certainly WOW most people.  Put this on fish, chicken, turkey, or any light meat or veggie and it works.<br /><br />Marmite has an advertising campaign that tells people that they will either love it or hate it.  I am definitely in the love camp.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029SGS3O"">Veggie-Glace Gold (Classic Roasted Vegetable Demi-Glace) - 1.5oz</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010OQP90"">More Than Gourmet Veggie-stock Gold; Vegetable Stock, 16-Ounce Packages</a>"

222090,"B. Walker ""Basia's Bookshelf""",5,"What's to say about Lindor Truffles?  Yum.  There isn't a bad flavor in the bunch, although I was genuinely surprised to find out Nestle is making Lindt products now.  You do have to make sure the truffles are kept at the right temperature - too cold and the truffle gets stiff, too warm and they get gloppy.  It's a shame they can't make them a little more stable, but hey, it's chocolate, so you can't complain too much.  This is a nice assortment of milk chocolate, dark chocolate, white chocolate, caramel and peanut butter.  The caramel and peanut butter are way too sweet and I suspect a recent addition due to the Nestle connection (not there years ago).  I'd like to see some of the fruit truffles added in the future, but overall, big thumbs up for the big, big bag of chocolate!"
48600,Jennifer,5,"I was a little wary trying these because I don't like dense, chewy bars that hurt your jaw to eat, and that's what I really thought this was going to be. I couldn't have been more wrong! I bit into it and got a crunch from the almonds on top and (I had to check the ingredients) soy crisps inside! I received one bar as a sample and went out and bought an entire box that same week! However, even though on the package it says that it tastes great heated up, I didn't like it. Heated up it lost the crunch and seemed to become that dreaded chewy bar. I still give this product 5 stars though because heating it up is definitely not something that you have to do!"

My cats, prior to eating this cat food, seemed to always be throwing up on the other stuff so a food change was a must.

I would recommend this product to anyone looking to heal themselves naturally!
465660,Selena,5,I REALLY like the True flavors.  It flavors your water without tasting syrupy and you can customize it with one or more packets to really make the flavor either subdue or pop. I couldn't find these in my normal grocery store (only the lemon) but am glad they're on Amazon.  I haven't tried the others.  I would recommend this product to those that do not like syrupy flavors or fake flavors in their water.

My parents have coconut trees and I'm used to coconut water straight from the coconut, with a straw! Not only is the packaging close to a real coconut, but the flavor is smooth, less processed-tasting, and very sweet without any added sugar. Coconut water is a very personal choice. People prefer one brand over the next for their own reasons, but give this one a shot. It has its own fresh taste and as close to cutting down a coconut as you're going to get."
147311,D. Faccone-Rusin,5,"I had read some pretty good reviews and thought I would try them for my grandson who is 7 months old.  He loved them and so did his mom.  They are great to take along anywhere and don't make the mess like other treats.  I hold it up and he gets so excited to see it and reaches for it.  He has several teeth but we have never had any problem with him choking on them.  They seem to dissolve in his mouth, even if he accidently bites off more than he should.  I will certainly buy more and try other flavors."

66509,TW,5,My 15 yr old cat was diagnosed with kidney disease a couple months ago and upon my vet's suggestion I began feeding kitty the Prescription Diet K/D wet and dry food.  My cat stopped eating the wet food all together after about a week (the dry food wasn't touched from the start) and started losing weight which was concerning.  I tried the Hi-Tor Neo Diet after reading the good reviews on Amazon.  I'm pleased to say my cat eats the Hi-Tor (my cat didn't care for the vita gravy stuff) so I didn't have to resort to force feeding (thank goodness!).  I'd definitely recommend the Hi-Tor as it's low protien and it's more palatable than the K/D.

We've tried all our favorite roasters (Stumptown, Intelligentsia, Victrola, Vita) and this one is the best at home.  It comes out a touch more mello than what you get from their commercial machines in the store, but the body and crema are rich, full, and inviting.  No reservations except that it's about the same price as in-store."

372437,nonpareil,5,"The regular coconut milk - I've had a bunch of cans of it and they're all the same - is roughly a third to half coconut fat or butter that is solid at room temperature but easily melted at low heat in microwave or pan. The rest of the can is a somewhat viscous milky fluid. This ""lite"" version has none of the solid fat. It is all the milky fluid. Presumably it has FAR less fat.<br /><br />Ingredients listed are ""water, coconut milk, guar gum"". I'd rather there were no guar gum but please note the manufacturer has refrained from adding sodium metabisulfite. Some other brands of coconut products add that in order to keep the product white. But Google it. Sources claim that sodium metabisulfite is actually poisonous. I'm not a chemist but prefer my coconut milk unadulterated and thank this company for giving us a relatively pure product.<br /><br />I recently made a dish, I think it is a pudding kind of thing, using this lite version. I cooked a cup of well-washed millet in 3 cups of lightly salted water for 40 minutes, removed from heat and immediately folded in a half cup of confectioners sugar, a third of a cup of almond meal, a whole can of this lite coconut milk and a half teaspoon of cinnamon. Stirred it well. It tastes good (to me) warm or cold and I can really taste the coconut flavor. I like a dish of it topped with dried sweetened cranberries and a dollop of whipped cream (sinful and so easy from the spray can)."

They are more fragile (although I haven't received a box that contained more than the typical couple broken crackers). I don't know about the nutrition or real grain content, but I just buy them because they are the most delicious cracker I've had, including all the other major brands.<br /><br />I highly recommend trying these. I mostly eat them plain, because aside from laziness and fragility, I just want to taste the cracker and it doesn't need topping."
