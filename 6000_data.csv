Petfood,Product was good. But please don't send stuff  if the stuff is bitten by rats. That Pedigree bag was torned by rats.  My stuff was ok but atleast try to correct that other wise  u will lose customer. Thanks and all the best happy Diwali!,5
Petfood,"Got it on a big billion day sale for a good discount. There were a couple of holes on both sides, probably hooks used to load, nonetheless the inner packing was in place. All in all, super happy doing business with flipkart! Lots of love to all the personnel involved in giving customers the best experience!",5

Petfood,very disappointed. the pedigree pack was opened and they had covered it with cellotape didn't expected this from flipkart. never gone order from flipkart. you'll say every product on flipkart is genuine but after receiving this order that myth has been busted. don't repeat this with any other customers.,1
Petfood,I ordered pedigree 1.2 kg but what I got is cat food.....and also no return policy ....what I do nowFlipkart u need to take action on seller.Please don't buy anything on this seller,1
Petfood,Extremely dissatisfied by flipkart as the product was already torn apart from backside and was taped all around to keep it intact. If there is no return or replacement policy on the product then you should make sure that the product you send doesn't have atleast this kind of defect.,1
Petfood,"As expected from flipkart,  my packet was opened and they used plastics to pack it so that no one can see the broken part of the packet. If you are ordering any dog food or non returnable item, i will suggest you to not use this flipkart to buy that item. No response when you call the helpline number. Totally wastage of money.",1

If you fully charged it then it will run hardly for 20-25 mins  & it's blade is also not very smooth, might have harm  your skin this is my pets experience.

Straightener,Please don't believe in lower price products behind their advertisement the product will be very bad .There is no heat controller as said in the cover of the product and after one use the heating panel ceramic coating will be peeloff and break our hair and hair will not be straight by this cheap product .my money has been lostPlease don't buy this product,1

Ironingboard,"Sturdy, worthy",5
Ironingboard,"The legs of the table have dents, there are various scratches on the top and the clips provided for fixing the legs are loose. I believe it is because of the poor packaging.

The build quality is amazing and the blade is so sharp. It is silent too. Don't think twice, just go for it. You will love it. Only drawback is that the blade is fixed so you can't remove it to clean. Other than that, I'll give it 10 out of 10.",5
Blender,"One of the best blender. Durable, noiseless, low in cost, more speed (1800 RPM) and easy to handle. Recommend for all types of blending.",5
Blender,"Good and powerful product but don't expect much from it. Don't use it for butter extraction purpose as it get heated in 2 to 3 minutes and takes near about 25 minutes to cool down completely. For milk shakes, chutney, puree it's perfect. It can make banana, mango, chiku, papaya, avocado, anjeer, dates, kiwi and many more shakes in just few seconds. So if you are searching it for butter extraction better skip a hand blender and go with mixer. But if your preference is milk shakes and smoothies...",4

Microwave,This is an awesome equipment with very few and negligible cons. The front glass is a bit too dark to see through in day light and you can only see clearly at nights. But with a few uses you should not require to look into your micro. The touch membrane is not exactly touch sensitive but needs a little push.

Microwave,It is the best solo oven in the market. I have purchased after comparing many models available and I choose the samsung. Since it is 23 litre many normal plate can be heated without any problem of fitting inside. It has many pre-programmed settings for ease of use. I mostly use for reheating which serves my purpose. Go for solo instead of convenction if you are only going to use for reheating. Baking is for otg oven.,5

Treadmill,"I have been using for 3 days now. Easy to install on your own. Does the job, speaker is not great but not bad as well....you can enjoy music while working out. Heart rate detection is not accurate and fluctuates a lot, but again I don't expect it to be accurate since it isn't a medical device. Overall its good for use if you are not a fitness freak.",4
Treadmill,"Totally worth the price. Been using it for the past 3 months. No issues that I faced, you can assemble it yourself and packing is done well.Pros-1. Can put your phone on he dashboard, has cup-holders2. Good Quality for the price3. Easy to fold, not too heavy.4. easy to move with wheels5. Easy setup(2 people)-15 minCons-1. Built in audio not that great",4

Treadmill,"Writing this review after 2 weeks of usage, I would say it is just an average treadmill typically good for walking, for jogging or running i would recommend Durafit. The motor is super silent below speed of 6, u will start to hear slight noise above 6. Also there is some clicking sound as soon as speed is increased from level 6, dont know whether it is problem with my treadmill or is it with this particular model of powermax machines. Its own weight is 50kg and is one of the reasons i bought ...",3

In less than half the price of offline similar products, the performance is wonderful. It was working fine until a couple of days. Then one night, my beloved Labrador puppy showed his power. During his daily biting exercise, he tore off both the power cable and data cable of the treadmill.I know this was certainly not a ‚Äúmanufacturing defect‚Äù,  on which most of the ...",5

Crampons,I buy it from flipkart.  It satisfy my requirements of air. Fan is good enough to buy.Quality of fan is best but design of blade can be better for more air delevery. i will buy more because it has large operating voltage 90~290 so it does no reduce its rpm. Blade quality and design should be more better than i give 5 star to it,4
Crampons,So very good coramton bldc fan so good warking and remote so good work so 5 year Waranty so good coramton barand and very fast delivrry Filifcart,5
Crampons,"Excellent quality product,bfor the rest of my life i will only buy Crompton bldc fan.I have a issue, just read the full review you will understand.There is a tick tick tick noise coming from fan at top speed (Speed 5 only).I call Crompton they send their service engineer to me within 3 hours.The engineer just took some coconut oil and tighten all the screw and the problem resolved instantly.Look like installation guy doesn't fit the üî© properly.The service engineer also well assured m...",5
Crampons,Well design and very high speed having fan . Well its a remote so easy to manage for older parents without taking any stress to go to switch board. Lovely product,5
Crampons,Wow best fan quality good remote properly good work ossam.verry nice. And thanx crompton,5
Crampons,"High Speed Bldc Fan far better than any other BLDC fan brand like Atomberg,etc. Got it for 1750üíµ Bucks.Blindly go for it if u want High speed and trusted brandü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞",5
Crampons,"Fan is Nice Crompton gives you a service as well but the fan speed is not so fast is just like, using 5 speed but actually output only 4 speed like. So that's the point overall good",3
Crampons,"For 370 RPM we had expected more speed. Because on similar 370 RPM in other brands like Havells BLDC Prime we are experiencing more speed.  Simple white. Small decoration is required in head. Safety wire, batteries for remote and better shackle kit is given in other brand like Havells for lesser price BLDC models also.  We have our opinion only, as a user and customer.  Blades also could be better like slightly curved in Usha. Blades could be powder coated, for smooth and good looking finish....",5
Crampons,Good air flow. little bit shaky during start. But good as far as air flow is concerned. But crompton has to think of better air flow with bldc motor design to come under excellent category.,4
Crampons,Waste time & money. Very bad experience. Last seven days working . But not working today . No service at Crompton side. So fan removed,1
Crampons,"Looks like used fan.. Someone had already returned it.. It wobbles from speed 3 to 5 .... I thought to return but It is a hectic process... I have to wait for a week..  at first there were black marks on my white fan bottom side.. I tried removing it, couldn't remove successfully with rubbing alcohol.. I don't know why they didn't consider customer satisfaction when unboxing..dirt marks on product ..",1
Crampons,"Remote is not working,fan have problem I spent 3200 but fan remote is not working very bad product",1
Crampons,Not working,1
Crampons,Not working after 2 week of installation,1
Crampons,It's not working properly,1
Crampons,From the first day gave me a bitter experience. Fan runs without remote. Remote has no control on fan. Sometimes Fan does not run instead of on condition.,1

AirCooler,"I gave the Review already when I bought this cooler in a month period you can find it below.Its been 4 months since I am using this cooler.I found drawbacks in it:1. The Air throw has been reduced , but the good thing is noise also reduced.2. The front air droplets are dropping down after some time. Earlier one used to get down, now both are getting down3. The supporting wheels has been broken when the cooler is turning a side, When I was turning one was broke first later other were bro...",4
AirCooler,"Cooling is grateful , build quality is very good , air throw is absolutely fine but  fan window is every time down without outer force this is big trouble. We every time up this window but after some minutes automatically window down all wind goes up side  .So felling not well . And quality of coller is very nice.Please find this problem solution and give us",3
AirCooler,"Awesome product by Bajaj.I have written this review after 2 week used this cooler. Pros:Fan speed is good, 3 level of speed control. Noise level is average. Cooling is good. Need to place cooler near to open windows. Descent looking..Design is cool and finishing of cooler is very good. Solid good plastic quality is used by company. Easy to move from one place to another place. Cons:Water drain process is manual and very complex. It always irretate me. Mosquito protection is not gi...",4
AirCooler,Flipkart delivery was excellent and on time . Cooler is nice and light weight though size is big. It is easy to move from one place to other. I am just giving 4 star because it's vent window doesn't remain steady it goes down within 15 -20 minutes. I saw similar reviews by many others but I went ahead and bought this thinking  BajaI might have rectified this issue but no luck . I use to keep cardboard piece to keep it sraight,4
AirCooler,fantasticvery fast delivery and cooler also very good comparing to the other cooler this cooler is good worth it for the price must buy,4
AirCooler,Very nice so nice fantastic cooler very good,5
AirCooler,After using for 2 months my review is --Really good cooler with superb airflow and good body but after getting delivered I noticed that pump is not working and that was immediately replaced next day by bajaj overall good experience.Pros---1. Good airflow than many coolers in the market2. 5 wheels for good balance3. Body is really made of good plastic4. Cord winder is given5. 2 yrs pump warrantyCons --1. Not easy to clean this cooler.2. A light indicator stopped working and company...,5
AirCooler,"Searching for air coolers for atleast 10 months. Tried many but all of them had some or the other problems. At last found this one on Flipkart and decided to give it a chance. And this cooler is impressive! Only thing that is necessary to point out that there's no IoT feature equipped in this product and the upper half of air deflectors drop down after sometime. Other than that, very good cooling, powerful air throw, looks good and fulfils expectations.",5
AirCooler,"Best cooler with great speed, powerful motor, good build quality and bajaj trust.It is better than Crompton like companies.",5
AirCooler,"After using a month, the sliding grill which is used to make plate up down for air adjustment is not working properly. If you set it to UPWARDS then after feew minutes it fails down.

The outer unit makes loads of sound.The water gets leak from the inside of the AC device and the technician who did it was doing it on someone else's behalf.This review is after 15 days of usage. Don't purchase this ac, instead go for another brandsIt is not a AC but a Heater it seems, i have registered a complaint to the brand aswell as Flipkart and One Assist Insura...",1
AirConditioner,Not at all cooling the room some times it cools and some times it won't work plzz don't waste your money on worth less product no one will respond to you you have to keep waiting and remote also very worth less display light will glow in light only not in dark i am running it in c4 mode just for air blower. This is not ac it is just air blower just waste of money and worthless product go to higher quality products dont look in to 5k to 10 k difference just go to better brands not with worse p...,1
AirConditioner,"This is good product and thanks to flippant for arranging the installation , uninstallation of old ac and giving the best price only available on the Flipkart App...the ac is 2023 model with manual and auto covertable feature is the best advantage for user the price is very less and quality features are the best in industry ...thank you Flipkart and realme and Flipkart installation n unstallation team ...the installation is to be paid in cash to the installation team it's aprox 1700 inr",5
AirConditioner,I researched a lot and read reviews on major AC brands. I finally narrowed it down to this product. I felt a little sceptical as it was a risk due to the brand tenure in AC. After usage of nearly a month. Very good product at the price point. Makes you feel satisfied with the risk taken. Thank you Realme for providing such an affordable AC with so many features at the price point,5
AirConditioner,"I got it at a good price with exchange and HDFC CC discount. The total experience was great. Additional piping, etc was required. The AC surpassed my expectations. It has more features than described in the listing. The ODU could have been provided with a steel protective grille. Efficient fast cooling, v good air flow, low power consumption (ISEER 5.13, consumption 1285W full power and 455W half power cooling). Measured grille temp 15.3C.",5
AirConditioner,"This product is very good with 4 in 1 convertible quality  and 5  star rating at this Affordable price. Overall this product is upto the expectation for good cooling, energy savings(5 star) , Air flow throw and 4 in 1 convertible function and mainly a good product at this much of Affordable price having such functions. The only negative Point I found that while using it is that... The operation of indoor unit become noisy as the tonnage increases as compared to other company AC... I think...",5
AirConditioner,"Was tight on budget and hence opted for this AC as it had good ratings and a 4 star BEE rating. Contrary to what others have said the AC indoor unit is quite calm, and outdoor has nominal noise,nothing abnormal. Looks okay and functional. Cooling is very good.I'm using it in a 160 sq foot room and it cools pretty wellGo for it",5
AirConditioner,"Wont recommend this ac to anyone. Cooling is very poor. Even at 16 deg it doesn't give cooling of 27 deg of other company ac. During peak summer not at all effective. Fan speed at high cant be camparable to slow of others, its that pathetic. And blades lowest swing will be at around 60 degree. Its a big mistake buying this ac.",2
AirConditioner,Very happy with the purchase but at the same I hate installation services provided by Jeeves. They always charge hefty amount instead of standard installation charges. Pros: 1. Very fast cooling 2. Inverter and 4 in 1 convertible AC3. Less power consumption Cons:1. Limited installation material available with AC kit.,5
AirConditioner,Please don't buy this product. Remote not working properly. Waste of money,1
AirConditioner,Good productBut installation charges is so high. Also technician behaviour is so bad and rude.,1
AirConditioner,Cooling is not good as compared to other AC.,1
AirConditioner,Not cooling at all,1

AirConditioner,Not working properly.....not cooling as compared to others,1
AirConditioner,Water pipe length is too short,1
AirConditioner,"This is the worst Airconditioner i had purchased, and regret my decision. Within 10 days of the purchase, The AC has stopped cooling. Very bad product on flipkart. I'm very disappointed with this.",1

Mascara,"Honestly this one is THE best mascara you'll ever find at that price. My eyes look absolutely gorgeous, it enhances the beauty of my eyes. To those who are facing issues removing this extremely waterproof thing, try applying few drops of olive oil and massage over the lashes and eyes.

WiredEarphones,The ear buds are larger it will hur to the ears. That's the major cause in this product. After 15 days mint use one side ear phone is working and connecter cable need to hold to hear sounds on both sides of ear phones.,1

4kTv,Bought it after my friend suggested it. It's really a good one. UHD at this price and it's a 2022 version. it connects like a charm.Switching between cable connection and net is very easy. It has eARC hdmi version 2.  Coming to TV inam really impressed by the performance. Dolby sound i heard in Disney hotstar (Movie Vikram) it was really super experience.,4
4kTv,It's a good product at this price. I got it for 13999 and bought it a month ago right after it was launched. Picture quality is great. Vivid colours with a variety of settings to match your colour preferences. Sound quality is good not great.. it's loud enough but il need a sound bar for more effective quality.. The only con is the remote sensor. It requires more than one attempt to switch it on.But other than that it's a really wonderful product with the latest features in this range.,5
4kTv,"Using 32 inch TV since 3 weeks overall Good TV , Value for money, picture quality is good for HD channels, SD channel are not very clear like HD.Quite disappointed with tv sound, if we increase the sound it's not audible clearly. Google assistant works properly.",4

Keep in mind the following issues1) There will always be a slight yellow tint which will never go away.2) The off-axis color shift will  never make you adjusted to one color.3)Wifi signal strength is pretty weak. I changed from one plus 7t and i would get full bars on wifi no matter in which part of my house I was in but pixel would always sho...,1
GooglePixel6Pro,Except display quality nothing was good. Finger print doesn't work sometimes. Face unlock works twice out of 10 times. In low light you can forget that there is face unlock feature.

AppleWatchSE,"Apple does seem to release stable product over time and has not ever shrunk from selling stable and durable products.Here are some findings after using the product for over 7 months now.Battery- Easily lasts for 2 days with 5% still to spare. Mind you I had done a 5Km walk climbed multiple stairs i these two days.Call & Voice- very easy to hear and crisp voice when used as a handsfree, very useful while drivingDurability- without any protective casing the watch fell once and got knocked o...",5
AppleWatchSE,Just just amazing and fall in love at firs glance. Truly love at first sight..! Apple you are amazing..! Incredible Flipkart for discount and fast delivery. Got delivered one day before my Europe trip... So much happy...! Guys go for it..! Classsss is here..!,5
AppleWatchSE,Apple watch does not need introduction..I am really impressed by the smooth operation and the kind of functionality it provides..  a must buy watch.. worth the money.  According to its price point especially during festive seasons it justifies its value for money more than series 4 or 5.,5
AppleWatchSE,My First Apple Watch!!! Simply Amazing.I used to wear China smartwatch earlier but I never felt anything like what I feel after wearing Apple Watch. It‚Äôs original and superb.The heart rate monitor is super accurate. Best part is that you simply can access all your notifications in your apple watch which means you don‚Äôt need to remove your cell from pocket again and again. You can reply to any messages in your watch itself and also it shows suggestions of auto replies which  I feel is best....,5
AppleWatchSE,best woman's day gift to my life.. perfect smart watch.. calling. chating.. alarm.. special when many things u cary via hands n cant able to answer call than most useful gudget.,5
AppleWatchSE,"Product is great ,but delivery took too long , happy with the watch and hoping for it to work good for days and years to come.",4
AppleWatchSE,"Delivery agent has thrown the product from grill gate to inside without even waiting for us to open the door. We called agent couple of times but left without even bothering. There are high chances of getting product damaged due to this.Who will be responsible if product is damaged, Also the product is not under exchange.You know how expensive a apple watch is. I didn't expect this from you guys. Not at all acceptable.SHAME !!! Pathetic !! Disguise!!!",1

AppleWatchSE,this is the biggest mistake of my life. dont buy this pc of garbage. it doesnt even pair with iphone 12 or 12 mini. it stays stuck on preparing and then gives an error you are not connected to internet even though you are connected with wifi and mobile data. flipkart does not accept return for such faulty items. please dont buy,1
AppleWatchSE,"you guys sent me a duplicate Apple watch, not once but twice and you guys are not even returning my money back. just saying they are working on it. nothing else . no Calls or emails they just cancel my return and refund request thrice, and I have to call everyday your customers care helpline and waste 2-3 hours. they just say they are working on it.  return my money asap.",1
AppleWatchSE,Update just won't install. It is cheating by Apple and Flipkart. They should stop selling the device and stop cheating their long term customers! Without update the device will not start only.....and Flipkart doesn't have return policy!! Cheating cheating cheating!! All my money went down the drains!!,1
AppleWatchSE,worst purchase ever. never buy on big billion day people. I got a faulty device,1
AppleWatchSE,Don't buy this product. No update available. We cannot coonct with phone. No return option  Cheating from flipcart,1
AppleWatchSE,"To start with - I wish there was a zero star or in minus if possible. I would like to highlight one of the worst online purchase experiences I have had so far, with my recent purchase on Flipkart. During the entire process, I felt totally cheated by Flipkart.Flipkart was more than happy to gobble up customer's hard-earned money, without any second thoughts and didn't even bother to address the grievance of a customer....I bought this apple 3 series watch... Size isn't fit for me.. i need ...",1

Sleep tracking is also quite accurate, and the only issue I have is with the BIA sensor which gives wildly fluctuating values for BMI and body composition. Aside from that, the watch is a solid piece of investment. Battery life maybe considered poor by a lot of people, but for the features the watch provides, 24 hours isn't that bad.

GooglePixel6Pro,I would say stay away from pixel. To those considering buying I just got pixel 7 pro from flipkart and it will just take away your peace of mind. Keep in mind the following issues1) There will always be a slight yellow tint which will never go away.2) The off-axis color shift will  never make you adjusted to one color.3)Wifi signal strength is pretty weak.

GooglePixel6Pro,"It's not worth buying. Absolute rubbish. Loses signal at least 20 times a day. Takes 5 min for signal to reinstate.

GooglePixel6Pro,Please don't buy this. White color is displayed as yellow. Even white text is yellow and it hurts eyes a lot.

In day light and night camera is performing worst.Overall money was waste on spending on this device.There is no clarity and loudness in the sound.I am giving this review after spending almost 10 days,1

GooglePixel5,Not happy with the phone. Not worth 30k. I would take it for around 17k. Only benefit is on the  android updates but that's occasional and you definitely do not update your phone everyday. Writing this after using phone for 4 months.,1
GooglePixel5,Don't buy it l. Lots of features. Good looking phone. But you can't use anything or else the phone will get hot like hell. You can't even hold it in your hand. The camera is good but only you can use it at night. In the daytime the phone can't tolerate the sun so it becomes very hot.,1
GooglePixel5,"My pixel review after 1 week of using it In short: Not worth for the money , too many issues.Cons:1.

GoogleNestWifiRouter,The Canon MG3670 printer is good but cartridge cost so high. I will recommend to buy for home purpose. Because it has a wifi facility that you can print directly through your phone by wifi and through pc and laptop by usb cable. Overall nice product.,4

GoogleNestWifiRouter,* Product is quite good after all its CANON.* Free Cartridge  provided (both black and white)* combined cost of both the cartidge is more than the printer * one cartidge can print only upto 60-70 page. * read the guide line properly and be careful while installing the cartidge.,4

Mobile phone by definition needs to be mobile and iphone 13 mini seems to be following the foundation principle! the best part is that there is no performance hit as compared to its expensive counterparts!

Apart from that everything else is just brilliant!!",5
AppleiPhone13mini,"Bought recently. It's a power packed compact device. Battery lasts one full day with mild use(scrolling,calls, taking few pictures etc) , the processor is a beast, handles everything u throw at it. But the main and probably only reason u want to buy this for its ultra compact size which feels great in the hands and ideal for one handed use. Camera is excellent for close and Normal range photography,not for Zoom photography. I really recommend u try this screen size once.",5
AppleiPhone13mini,"I needed a handy phone and the only available option was the mini line-up of iPhone (strange that only Apple thought about making a smaller phone where everyone else is making it bigger). My only reservation was about the battery life - but it‚Äôs not bad at all. I easily get about 7 hours of screen time on every 100% charge which last me whole day of normal use.If you are looking for a power packed phone with compact form factory, it‚Äôs the best option.",5

SamsungGalaxyS22,Best phone available at this price with the new offer. Buy it if you want to use as a secondary phone. Camera is top of the line. I have a 15 k mi note eleven with two days battery life so this battery being smaller is not a concern for me. Beautiful phone and NOT CHINESE importantly.,5
SamsungGalaxyS22,I'm a hard-core Android user.. and this phone proves to be excellent in performance.  Feels very classy in hand and the size is just perfect for people like me looking for a pocket able phone.. feels just amazing in hand.

OnePlusNord,"A Midrange phone from OnePlus.Why I choose this phone is only because of the Brand value.We have more other options like Vivo T1 ,Realme 9,9pro , Oppo ,Motorola.But the OnePlus has their own premium feel The reason why I have given only 4 star:-1-The AMOLED display is not there.But it is not important.2- Wide angle lens is also not there.3- They have removed Alert slider.Other wise the phone is perfect. I am satisfied with this device 95%.You can go for it.The important thing is tha...",4

OnePlusNord,"So I was sceptical about buying this budget phone of a premium brand as I guessed there would be obviously some shortfalls as compared to the normal range phones like oppo, realme etc. I have been using this phone since a week and I shall write my reviews based on my user experience. My previous phone was realme and have also used redmi note 10 pro, so I shall compare with them as well. I'm not a techie but as a common smart phone user let me jot down what I felt.Pros: Phone looks absolutel...",4
OnePlusNord,Camera is good..battery draining fast after some days..speed is good no issue .. sound is also good but there is no dual speaker so what else u can expect.. overall it's a good phone in this price range of 20k,3

OnePlusNord,"Good phone but battery is not up to the mark. Battery drains faster when it's moderate usage. 33w charger is the only plus.Phone feels little heavier while comparing other phones at this price segment.OnePlus logo is not clearly visible at backside.Some features like ""Google Service for VR"" is not working in this model.Overall I can give 3 rating out of 5.",3

VivoX60Pro,I have always been a fan of Vivo phones and hence had gone with X60 Pro.The phone packaging is absolutely gorgeous!The phone is good to hold and looks n feels premium with its curved edges. The camera is absolutely spectacular n takes some great shots even in night mode. The stabilization features are top notch.The phone gets charged from 20% to 97% within an hour which is good to last a complete day. The UI is fun n responsive.The front camera is also excellent and provides cool features...,5

VivoX60Pro,This is my first Vivo purchase and I'm happy with it.It's very sleek and the performance is also good cause of the 870 chipset.Camera definitely works as claimed and one of the best in this price range.There is some heating issue and battery could have been at least 5000 mAh at this price point but apart from these two things it's a good buy. The only one that can compete with this is the new one plus 9 series. I went with this after checking it in a store and liked it a lot.,5
VivoX60Pro,"Camera is actually A1, night mode photos will surprise you.Only one thing is blacks are bit in gray tone......Display is nice and smooth......UI is very clean, only 4-5 unwanted vivo apps that you can't remove......Good battery life......Comes with a headphones which has good sound quality, with a mob case which is pretty decent and with a headphone jack as well as a Flash Charger.....Review after one day of use.",5

I bought it I asked for replacement, they had sent some guy to check if it's faulty, it was not faulty, and said battery is like that only no issue with the model we cannot take it back.For someone who is out throughout the day battery is a main concern. Definitely a great phone but not battery life It drains very fast",3
SamsungGalaxyS20+,The device is good in all aspects except the battery.  If you are using a 60hz refresh rate display or a single sim doesn't matter battery is draining. Sometimes slight heating issues also. Comparing the price range of other models this device is still on top because of the snapdragon chipset and many other features. The device is good but not so great if you are a heavy user who needs more battery backup .,4

SamsungGalaxyS20+,Never again going to buy product from flipkart. Received product already had a text message which indicates phone is tampered/used. Provided proofs but return request is unnecessarily dragged on although there is clear evidence of text message in phone. Appears like a tactics to exhaust customers and give up.,1
SamsungGalaxyS20+,Horrible  product. It Heats up so much you cannot talk on phone for more than 5 mins. It would simply blast. Be aware nor samsung nor Flipkart will take this seriously. They will send technician and they will mark ok even if it is not. They test the phone when its not operational. They checkbthe phone for 5 mins and says we used for half n hr. The screen has already started flickering..  if anything happens flipkart will only give u a run around. Shame on you Flipkart for Ripping off someone ...,1

PocoX2,Sony IMX 686 sensor is really flagship level camera sensor. Captured pitch dark night sky with google camera night sight (Astrophotography) mode and got very impressive results which can easily beat a DSLR camera. The stars captured in image were so fade in reality that they were not even visible to naked eyes. Snapdragon 730G SOC is powerful enough to handle the most graphics intensive operations. Played few games capable of achieving 120 fps and they were easily handled by this processor....,5
PocoX2,"This is the  new Phone I'm using after 4 years. My old Phone was Redmi note 4. Poco X2 was awesome. Meet my expectations. Loved it. Overall  good performance. A little bit disappointed with the night camara performance. Otherwise it's a superb android phone. Display 120 RR really works well.

RedmiNote9ProMax,Have been using this mobile from last one week. And was able to figure out that 1)Mic will not work on speaker mode. Also earpiece volume is very low even when it is set to maximum. So it means phone is lacking it's basic feature. And it's not an issue with my phone. When I google it found many users have reported about this issue.

RedmiNote9ProMax,Best phoneI always use mi phoneRedmi mostly used snapdragon processor it's advantage in redmi. Camera quality Inhanced by redmi salute for this. Battery back quite good. Internet speed very nice for this processor. Glassy design in back panel very lovely. Memory card option dedicated quite amazing. It's vey usedful.

RedmiNote9ProMax,Not much satisfied. Since last one year I've been using this phone. Facing issues with usability (e.g. suddenly fall to home screen from app using for time period of more than 15 mins). Other apps which open in minimise mode which got collapse and restart when jump to the one app to another app after a timespan of 15 to 20 mins or in few apps which same issue occur in 5 to 10 mins. Anytime got stuck issues,2
RedmiNote9ProMax,Every thing is good in this mobile but i am not satisfied with battery because battery capacity 5020 but it's like a 4000 mah battery. Not a full day. It's drain very fast this is the main problem. Overall good mobile,1
RedmiNote9ProMax,Have been using this mobile from last one week. And was able to figure out that 1)Mic will not work on speaker mode. Also earpiece volume is very low even when it is set to maximum. So it means phone is lacking it's basic feature. And it's not an issue with my phone. When I google it found many users have reported about this issue. So it's definitely not a phone who wants to use speaker mode or need to talk in crowdy noise place. Only solution is to run MI service center to fix this bug whic...,1

Microwave,"Awesome microwave within a perfect price.I am using it for last 13 days and I must say that,this is working perfectly good.My only advice to all of you specially who were going to use the microwave for the 1 st time,that stricly avoid any kind of metal to use in it,though it is clearly written in the book comes with it,but after everything I want to warn you that don't use any kind of metal to avoid any of temporary/permanent damaged.Except this,everything is just fantastic.",4
Microwave,This is one of the best budget microwave available in the market and the pricing of the product on the offer period makes it more pocket friendly to the users. Now there are products that are available at a creeper price to but this is a trusted brand and you can buy the product without thinking much about the after sales tension like repairs and maintenance.,5
Microwave,"We've been using this MwO for over a month now, almost daily and for every meal. It is the perfect heating device for a small family like ours (3 of us). We have another much bigger and fancier one in the kitchen, with grill, convection, etc., purchased with a lot of enthusiasm but hardly used.The idea is to keep it near the dining table. Because all that most of us do with it is heat food just before eating. This one does the job perfectly well, besides cooking the occasional idli, egg p...",5
Microwave,"This is a basic but up to the mark microwave by Bajaj. Its 17L but is sufficient for normal usage like heating up food. I go one step ahead and prepare ghee as well as cakes in it, I am super thrilled with this product. Moreover delivery was prompt by Flipkart and the Bajaj Customer Care people called immediately for a demo of the product. For the price above, its totally worth it.",5
Microwave,Very good at low prices.It Good! It Good! This is Very easy to use for all family members. Very nice to design and view. It takes up very little space to keep in the kitchen. I am happy and satisfied for this.,4
Microwave,"Don't even bother about any other solo microwave model. flipkart you flip my mind with ur Good service, responsible people & Bajaj (can't beat them in customer service). besides the height , width & weight of this product is like feather. You/mum/dad/younger siblings can move it anywhere you like in any corner & such a sleek model.",5
Microwave,"Well , while buying this microwave I didn't actually know what a convection , grill or solo microwave meant . Please research on different types of microwaves available in market and decide before hand what type you want to buy.This microwave doesn't come with bells and whistles . It has simplest of the controls ( power setting and timer ) . You choose according to your need ( Based on trial and error ) . Rest everything is average including build quality , asthetics etc.",4
Microwave,Good,3
Microwave,I have been using this from past almost 2 yrs now. Works absolutely fine. Perfect for daily kitchen needs. Just keep the interior clean to avoid food odours. Recommendation from my side.,5
Microwave,Waste one. This is not a microwave oven. More then my food My bowl only getting heat. Deforest option not available. I kept frozen chicken for defreez. But it's become half boiled. At last the bell sound is waking up everybody who sleeps in my bed room. I applied for replace with Samsung oven. But they denied. Total waste of money. I am using Samsung oven at my office. And Bajaj at home. I can see the huge difference. Just to save 2k Rs. I brought Bajaj. But I lost 4k. Pls go for Samsung.,1

Mattress,Superb comfortable Wakefit mattress..when u lay on it..the body weight is evenly managed with neither too soft or hard but if u sit on the sides then it squeezes being too soft at the sides.. Overall a VFM product..Go for it...i opted 8 Inch king size along with Wakefit matress protector..My only problem was with the Delivery courier delivery boy who wanted my help to bring the matress to my doorstep.. he should have his partner while delivering these type of heavy products but he came alone...,5
