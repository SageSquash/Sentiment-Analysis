 BERT-based Sentiment Analysis from Ecommerce website Reviews
This repository contains code for performing sentiment analysis using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). BERT is a powerful language representation model that has achieved state-of-the-art performance on various NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis.

The goal of this project is to train a BERT-based model to classify the sentiment of textual data into three classes: positive, negative, and neutral. The model utilizes the BERT architecture for text preprocessing and encoding, followed by additional layers for classification.

The dataset used for training and evaluation in this project is collected by scraping customer reviews from Flipkart. The dataset consists of labeled text samples categorized into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. The scraping process extracts reviews from various product categories to provide a diverse set of data for training the sentiment analysis model.

The repository provides a setup and installation guide, as well as instructions for downloading the necessary pre-trained BERT models. It includes a main script for training and evaluating the sentiment analysis model, along with utility functions for data preprocessing and evaluation.

The trained model achieves an accuracy of 85% on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in sentiment analysis tasks.

Contributions to the project are welcome, and you can submit issues or pull requests for improvements or bug fixes.
